Just would love to get more color from you.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.768, 'pos': 0.232, 'compound': 0.9746}"
660,"Okay. Thank you. Maybe a bigger picture question on Marcus and the competitive landscape there. I think your vision is really to build out a comprehensive digital consumer platform. Sounds like other folks are thinking the same thing. JPMorgan launched its Finn digital initiative, Citi is talking about expanding and enhancing its footprint, and even PNC is talking about its retail national bank. So, in light of that sort of – that evolving competitive landscape, what's Goldman's edge in building out Marcus here?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.818, 'pos': 0.182, 'compound': 0.8957}"
661,"Hi. My question relates to why isn't Lloyd Blankfein staying to the end of the year, and what changes do you expect with David Solomon taking over the helm? And if Lloyd or David's on this call, if they could answer, that would be great.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.915, 'pos': 0.085, 'compound': 0.6249}"
662,"All right. Well, if I can follow up. Just in terms of the backlog being up, what's the percentage change, because you're saying it's a record backlog first quarter to second quarter. How much is that up?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.942, 'pos': 0.058, 'compound': 0.2732}"
663,"So last follow-up. So is this a sign that the economy is finally turning up a notch? We had the tax cut. We had some excitement about reflation, we're waiting for this to kick in more forcefully. So now you have record backlogs that you just described, is that a function of that or is that just unique to Goldman Sachs? Sometimes these revenues are lumpy.","{'neg': 0.032, 'neu': 0.915, 'pos': 0.053, 'compound': 0.3527}"
664,"Good morning. So a couple from me. One, looking back at last quarter, one of the things I liked at least about the quarter was the spike in the balance sheet and we didn't really see a follow-through into this quarter. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing as far as client demand for your balance sheet and kind of what your outlook is there?","{'neg': 0.022, 'neu': 0.894, 'pos': 0.084, 'compound': 0.6369}"
665,"Okay. You mentioned the tax rate. I believe you said 20% for 2018, which is what you'd expected. Hadn't you before been talking about 23% or 24% kind of longer term? Is that a 2018-specific decline or should we be thinking about the longer term tax rate being lower as well?","{'neg': 0.042, 'neu': 0.875, 'pos': 0.083, 'compound': 0.2869}"
666,"Good. One follow-up question and one other question. On the follow-up, I know we talked already about the comp ratio and I know in your commentary you indicated, you know, look, that's going to be a function of revenues but also profitability. So my question is around profitability. Are you kind of suggesting to us in that commentary that you really don't want to go below a 12% ROE because if we kept the 41%, it would have been below that.","{'neg': 0.021, 'neu': 0.89, 'pos': 0.088, 'compound': 0.6704}"
667,"Okay. So when you mentioned the profitability as one of the factors for assessing that, were you thinking about ROE or is there a different profitability measure you're thinking about?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.81, 'pos': 0.19, 'compound': 0.6249}"
668,"I know it's a new business for you guys but I definitely appreciate the attempts to improve and enhance the disclosures there. You mentioned the 4% to 5% annual loss rate on Marcus. Is that still through-the-cycle view? Number one. And then are you provisioned at a level that's greater than that currently, given that we're in the later innings of the cycle and can you give us some perspectives on that?","{'neg': 0.036, 'neu': 0.766, 'pos': 0.198, 'compound': 0.9195}"
669,"Cool. Thank you. And then another one is the narratives and chatter we're hearing on cash management and how you guys are considering a shift towards cash management. Actually, I think, Marty, you have referenced that in prior calls. How should we think about how you're considering positioning yourselves in the marketplace there? What do you think would differentiate Goldman's offering versus competitors? What do you think the value proposition of Goldman is in that business, because it's rather different than what we're used to thinking of as far as Goldman and the position in the marketplace?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.922, 'pos': 0.078, 'compound': 0.7744}"
670,"Thanks. Good morning. Before I ask a question, I know he's not on the call, but I just thought in case he listens to it later or something, I think, really, we all owe a hat tip to Lloyd for his leadership over these 12 years through good times and bad, and some things that were very idiosyncratic to Goldman Sachs, which he managed through, I think, super effectively with the team, so just a hat tip to him. Beyond that, I also wanted to say thanks for the Marcus data, which I thought was interesting, and also a little bit of color you gave on some of the other initiatives that were laid out back in September of last year. We are coming up on the one-year anniversary of when you laid those out in some detail and I was wondering when might we expect a more fulsome discussion of kind of where you are in terms of meeting some of those objectives?","{'neg': 0.028, 'neu': 0.831, 'pos': 0.141, 'compound': 0.9618}"
671,"Okay. I think that that'll be really helpful, so thank you for that. Just on something that is related but is going to be maybe a little nitpicky given that it's a quarter, but I'm just curious. In the Equities business, which you pointed to, the fact is you were flat year-over-year in the second quarter at a time when your peer group that has reported so far were up on average, I think, so far about 20% year-over-year. Granted there's 10-point sensitivity to these types of analyses, but I'm just wondering, were there any particular things that might have held you back in the Equities business this quarter as we try to think about how we kind of annualize and go forward.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.91, 'pos': 0.09, 'compound': 0.8493}"
672,"Hey, good morning. First, maybe just follow-up on Marcus; I thought it was interesting that you're looking to expand in the UK. Just what kind of drove that decision and could we see follow-through with perhaps a lending product in the UK or do we see other markets – do you enter other markets? How do we think about where that's heading?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.871, 'pos': 0.129, 'compound': 0.8053}"
673,"Fine. I mean you're not limiting Marcus to the domestic, I think is obviously the takeaway here, I guess?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.893, 'pos': 0.107, 'compound': 0.2023}"
674,"Okay. And maybe just a question on the SCB impact. Obviously, as you pointed out, year-to-year it can be very different. Are there ways – if it stays – as the economy continues to get better and the test seems to get tougher and tougher, is there a way to reduce stressed volatility in your view or do you think there might be changes to the test? Because it is a pretty big step-up to the SCB from the prior buffer and just trying to think through your model and some of the pure play investment banks seem to get hit harder in the stress test. Is there anything you see that's sort of easy to do that could help alleviate some of that or is it just sort of you've got to deal with it year-toyear?","{'neg': 0.035, 'neu': 0.832, 'pos': 0.133, 'compound': 0.9056}"
675,"Great. Thanks. Good morning, Marty. I guess a question on Clarity Money and just what you guys have done since the acquisition, the strategy to drive more customers into the app, and then just how we should think about that in terms of kind of broader consumer finance and wealth management growth, especially as you add more products to the offering.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.742, 'pos': 0.258, 'compound': 0.9545}"
676,"Okay. Great. Thanks for the color. And then maybe a follow-up here just on kind of the Investment Banking commentary. It seems that any time we're talking about record backlogs, we get questions around whether we're close to a cyclical peak. And so when you look across the franchise, how do you think about that just based on the metrics that you look at? Meaning what areas seem to be maybe hitting close to on all cylinders and are there areas or regions where you just feel like there could be quite a bit of upside just to even get back to some type of baseline activity level?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.896, 'pos': 0.104, 'compound': 0.8948}"
677,"Good morning, Marty. Hi. Couple questions for you. You pointed out that you guys were the number one provider or underwriter of leveraged loans in the quarter. Can you give us some color on the underwriting trends you're seeing there since you're such a strong player in this market? For example, debt-to-EBITDA or other type of metrics that you guys look at. Are they becoming more aggressive, less aggressive? Can you share us some color there?","{'neg': 0.046, 'neu': 0.831, 'pos': 0.123, 'compound': 0.7546}"
678,"Very good. And looking at your net interest income, you'd pointed out that it's at a run rate of about $2.5 billion, just under I think 7% or so of total revenues. Where do you see that over the next three to five years as Marcus grows and as you grow your corporate loan book, where do you think that can reach as a percentage of revenue?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.893, 'pos': 0.107, 'compound': 0.7425}"
679,"Hi. Thank you. Hi, Marty, thank you for the color that you gave on the Equities business. I really appreciated the disclosure regarding the cash and the derivatives, however, I was mostly interested about Prime Brokerage. You basically suggested that the numbers were flat year-on-year despite the fact that it seems like all your peers said that year-on-year revenues were up. So I was trying to understand whether there was an issue primarily with the margins or something happened regarding your volumes and that you couldn't grow the business. And I've got a second question in Asset Management as well.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.829, 'pos': 0.171, 'compound': 0.9468}"
680,"Okay. Thanks for that. And then from a modeling perspective, just trying to understand on the Asset Management. First of all, is there any kind of seasonality in incentive fees that we can use going forward? And then secondly, would you say -- I know that incentive fees are one off by nature but was there something particular one off this quarter?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.859, 'pos': 0.141, 'compound': 0.7193}"
681,"Hey, good morning. A quick question on the NII that's in the I&L. I know you gave the run rate of being $2.5 billion. Is there a way to give what's been the biggest contribution to that run rate right now? Is it the merchant bank? Is it the corporate lending initiatives? And then kind of what was the corporate lending growth quarter-onquarter?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.9, 'pos': 0.1, 'compound': 0.755}"
682,"Great. And then just real quick on the stress test. Given your results and some of the specific loan categories tended to be much worse than what peers were, specifically kind of looking at how your results came out within residential mortgage. Does that affect how you manage that business going forward? Because that's hard to see how when the Fed's giving you almost 50% cumulative losses that you're going to get an appropriate risk adjusted return on invested capital with those kind of loss rate assumptions being built in. Is that just a portfolio that you could walk away from at some point?","{'neg': 0.127, 'neu': 0.817, 'pos': 0.056, 'compound': -0.7422}"
