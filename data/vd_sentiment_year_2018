You generated 25.5% this year. You’ve got in excessof 100BPS tailwind from retention. You’ve got, as you highlighted, several other factors driving improvement there. So, I guess, the question is, the lower end seems pretty conservative particularly if we think about 2019 when those retention packages roll off. And you’ve got a primary competitor that’s pointed to a 30% long-term target, albeit no date tied to that. So, is there any reason why you would think that competitors would have a higher margin upside than yours?

And I’d say you’ve been a positive outlier relative to a lot of your peers in that regard within that business. I’m just curious, underlying the 26% to 28%, which, James, you noted as conservative, what assumptions you’re making on non-comp inflation.

To follow up to Glenn’s question, you noted that you expect no meaningful change in equity or the ROE denominator as part of the targets that you’ve outlined. It’s pretty clear that you’re more than adequately capitalized at this point.

13,"Thanks. That was really helpful. And then the follow-up question would be on the theme of reinvestment. Obviously, that’s driven a lot of conversations with investors over the last few weeks, discrete type of benefits like taxes. Or in your case, one of the things that’s coming up in a year or so is the runoff of the retention contracts in Wealth Management.

14,"Well, listen to my thought process and correct where you think I’m wrong, and I think the answer is going to be partly because you’re reinvesting. But you’re at a 9.4% ROE in 2017. And with the new lower tax rate, you’re in your new range of 10% to 13%. Your efficiency target of under 73%; you’re at 73% in 2017. And Wealth Management, the margin – again, it’s great progress this decade, but you’re range is 26% to 28% and you’re already at 25.5%. And with the expiration of some of the contracts, you’ll be in range. So it looks like, just looking at your results in 2017 and the things that are definite that you should make your new 2018 to 2019 target. So I guess my question is, are your new targets high enough?","{'neg': 0.032, 'neu': 0.807, 'pos': 0.161, 'compound': 0.9678}"

And then Jon, just on the 22% to 25%, does that include some of the noise that we’ll see from quarter-to-quarter in the equity comp accounting?

Are you still reinvesting cost saves but you’re still taking out cost in some places, reinvesting other?

And the reason I'm getting at that is there's, don't know, half the banks that had this particular impact in this particular quarter before we got into the actual rate going down.

Your peers will have the same thing.

So, I guess, just how confident are you over a multiyear period that you can sustain that premium and improving ROE?

It seems like there’s some accelerated depreciation and what have you.

Because it seems that this kind of benign backdrop that we’ve been in here recently has been good for other businesses.And so, how should we think about volatility and the mix of what that means for all of Goldman Sachs? Is it amean reversion of volatility and that’s good for the whole business?

And so where – I mean you touched on it a bit with your product mix. But where do you see your competitive advantages? Is it that you're lower cost? Is it the products?

If we could really look under the hood and understand what we were seeing.So we see your revenues growing organically. And that to me a validation that you're investing at a sufficient pace. And we see where expenses are. And that's some validation that you really are taking the cost out.

And as you enter the 2018 CCAR cycle with capital levels that are well in excess of your required minimums.

That said, 30% of your business is in the wholesale bank.That is – it is a very relationship oriented business. It's also a business that it potentially can be less sticky.

Or is it because they're transaction you just don't think there's a lot of pressure for repricing retail deposits right now?Right. And you're still getting good growth, so it's a good thing. Has the – if you look at the short-endof the curve your rate sensitivity numbers at the short-end really don't seem to have changed over thepast year despite multiple rate hikes.

So one of the questions we've been getting is around the branch build-out of 500 branches that you're looking to do in new markets.

366,"Hi. I guess I have a good news-bad news question. The bad news for you, Brian, you know, the tax cut was supposed to lead to a lot for loan growth, the higher rates were supposed to lead to much higher margins, volatility was expected to lead to much higher trading not from your guidance, but just generally in the market, and as we sit here, it's been a good meal, but where is the dessert? So I guess the question there is should we expect more of a benefit from that in the future? And if not, why, or how long does it take?And then the good news is even without the dessert, so to speak, you guys still had some very nice efficiency, so if you could elaborate more on the record consumer efficiency and tie that more to the 1.4 billion quarterly hits you had in digital banking, like how much of the consumer efficiency is due to digital versus, say, branch closures or other actions.

But trading assets were up 17% year-on-year, so we can't see trading assets slip between FICC and equity so just looking for a little more color.

369,"Okay. That's good. And then just one other question. I think in the past, a flatter yield curve was a predictor of a slowdown in – or credit issues a slowdown in the economy or maybe even a recession, but the curve is pretty darn flat right now but the economy's great. So curious from your vantage point what it means to your balance sheet, how you're positioned business wise and balance sheet wise, and how much we should be concerned about the flatter curve.","{'neg': 0.019, 'neu': 0.676, 'pos': 0.305, 'compound': 0.9805}"

372,Yes. That's exactly the point. Great. And then if I could follow-up just on the commercial lending front. You guys would also seem to be among the best position to see the small business middle market commercial uptick.

I'm just wondering what your thoughts are in terms of how much further pressure there might be in that category?

First, Paul, since you're getting the mark-to-market in your equity already, is there some thought that periodically, you'll go in and refresh the yields to get the benefit in the income statement while you're already taking the hit on the equity side?No, I understand. I kind of – maybe I didn't do the question right. I'm thinking you can take actions because you're forced to already recognize the loss on the AFS portfolio. You might as well go ahead and restructure, be able to buy new bonds, even you're buying the same duration because you can generally add – I just did the math – somewhere between $0.15 and $0.20 just by going in and rounding up the yields when you're already taking the hit on the equity side.","{'neg': 0.04, 'neu': 0.9, 'pos': 0.06, 'compound': 0.4019}"
378,"Okay. And then, Brian, the second question I really wanted to focus on was you've kind of eliminated the tracking on mortgage banking as even a line item on the income statement for fees. My background and being interested just that particular business, you've gone from buying Countrywide, which was supposed to be a major strategic move for the company – we all know what happened there, not by any of you all's your fault and you've done a great job of working through that. But just thinking strategically from where you've come from with it not being a business segment and now it's actually limited in the sense of what you're looking at from a line item on the fee income statement. So just strategically kind of think about that shift and what that means going forward.I feel like you're making the right transitions here. Just interesting to see how far the industry hascome from a transaction business to a balance sheet-driven business.

The Fed funds rate is up, what, something like, Idon't know, 80 basis points in the last year, and the net interest margin is unchanged.Now I know there's a lot of dynamics; mix of business, the whole shape of the yield curve, shape ofthe balance sheet, et cetera, but when does the net interest margin of this bank start to reflect thechanges in overall interest rates in the economy?","{'neg': 0.008, 'neu': 0.847, 'pos': 0.145, 'compound': 0.9801}"

963,"Okay, great. And then it seems like you’ve had a good handle on CCAR the past few years.

Are you trying to apply any different metrics? In an earlier question in response to Scott Cavanagh’s question, an earlier answer, you said 660s are tracking like 660s.

Should we see that as how you see growth in risk-weighted assets that you manage or grow into, or is it more indicative of volatility you see associated with RWAs? What should we infer from this variance?It sounded like what you were saying is, if I could explore it a little bit more, you seem to be refi-ing what’s coming up. Is that the right takeaway from what you’ve said here? Or am I being...So again, if I say, the right way to look – is the right way to look at this, it’s $7B or $8B buffer plus/minus?

If you think about it, anyone aged maybe 18 to 35, let's say, 40, hasn't really been an adult and had a bank account in an environment where they had interest on any of their deposits.

If you don't own the shares of Citi or underweight improvement, which one of these factors would most let you change your mind? A, loan growth; B, margin; C, fee income; D, expenses, dividend,buyback and valuation? And interesting, loan growth and expenses......are the two clear winners.

You may recall at Investor Day, Citi pointed to $9, but it since revised some of its other targets.Let's see what the audience response is and then, we'll ask John to opine. You may recall what his slide had,consensus for 2019 at only $7.50.And so, it's evenly split, basically in the $8.75 to $9.75, so not much of an increase despite tax reform.Interestingly, if you look at this conference last year, the most huge responses, 46% of the participants at $8.25 to $8.75. And you'll look today, that number has actually declined, 32%, despite the fact of a lower-than-expected tax rate.Yeah. A little bit surprising.

One of the things investors look at is loan growth, and kind of some underlying loan growth has been good.

1071,"I see. And just finally, in this whole commercial competitive area that you've referenced, is it primarily in the legacy PNC footprint or are you also seeing it in your newer markets that you've been expanding into?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.954, 'pos': 0.046, 'compound': 0.1779}"
1072,"Thanks. Good morning, guys. Recently there's been some talk, talking about banks of your size and the potential maybe helpers on the regulatory front from either capital or liquidity. I know you've discussed this in the past, but I'm just wondering just where that conversation sits in your mind and what you're, at this point, hoping for directionally.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.853, 'pos': 0.147, 'compound': 0.7992}"
1073,"Yeah. Okay, got it. So, a little wait and see on that. And then, just a follow-up on the choices that you have on the mix of the excess cash. What are you doing right now in terms of just – investment portfolio, obviously, was up at period end but in terms of the types of new rates you're seeing versus what's rolling off the back book is in the securities book?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.919, 'pos': 0.081, 'compound': 0.5927}"
1074,"Yes. And Bill, one just follow-up on that. Will you continue to move that synthetic to cash [ph] as at (42:02) this point of the rate cycle? How do you balance just where you stand on asset sensitivity versus starting to kind of mortgage it a little bit?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.89, 'pos': 0.11, 'compound': 0.6767}"
1075,Good morning. I just wanted to follow up on some of the deposit conversations and questions. We've seen the period end non-interest-bearing deposits drop significantly. And you mentioned part of that was due to business customers. Was there any shift also from the consumer side? And do you expect the rate of change between noninterest- bearing deposit growth and interest-bearing deposit growth to remain the same going into the fourth and first quarters?,"{'neg': 0.027, 'neu': 0.866, 'pos': 0.108, 'compound': 0.7476}"
1076,"Okay. So when I think about the shift to digital, I mean you already have plenty of liquidity, you're meeting your LCR ratio, your loan to deposit ratio is running in the mid-80s, much better than most of your peers. When I look at the digital offering, are you going to be a price leader here in the beginning, just to show that you can grow those deposits and then slow it down?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.933, 'pos': 0.067, 'compound': 0.5859}"
1077,"Do you see that starting to generate higher loan growth on the consumer side, particularly in card and auto, because of that shift?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.894, 'pos': 0.106, 'compound': 0.3818}"
1078,"Rob, I was wondering if you could follow up a little bit, and I apologize if you answered this already, but on the expense guidance for the fourth quarter, I'd like you to talk a little bit about having some of the seasonal marketing expenses that would be in that guidance for the fourth quarter. But are you assuming that the FDIC surcharge is still in that expense for the fourth quarter?","{'neg': 0.032, 'neu': 0.908, 'pos': 0.06, 'compound': 0.2542}"
1079,"And if I understand correctly, even if it's still there for the fourth quarter, one way or the other, it's not going to be in 2019, right? So, there will be some sort of settlement?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}"
1080,"So, if anything, the fourth quarter guidance you're giving is not an expectation of a normalized expense level. I know you're not giving 2019 guidance yet, but let's just say it's a seasonal item.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.895, 'pos': 0.105, 'compound': 0.34}"
1081,"Okay. So, will that digital investment be something that stays into the expense base going forward? I guess is that what would be different?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.907, 'pos': 0.093, 'compound': 0.3094}"
1082,"Hi. Good morning. So I was hoping to maybe start off, Brian, with just a question on the investment bankingstrategy. There's been a lot of focus in the press on some of the senior personnel changes at the investmentbank, whether your lack of risk appetite may have negatively impacted revenue growth. And was just hoping you can maybe set the record straight, give us your own perspective on BAC's performance relative to the peer set across those businesses, and maybe how you're planning on striking out right balance between responsible growth, while maintaining that commitment to risk-adjusted returns.","{'neg': 0.04, 'neu': 0.77, 'pos': 0.191, 'compound': 0.9399}"
1083,"Extremely helpful color, so I appreciate remarks from both of you. Just one follow-up for me and I'll head back in the queue, on loan growth. You talked in the past about mid-single-digit loan growth being a sustainable target for the core businesses. It's been a very steady trend that we've seen over the last few quarters. The commercial side did slow down a bit. I know you had alluded to that. I'm just wondering whether you're still committed to delivering that mid-single-digit loan growth and whether that's just sustainable target from here in your view.That's perfect. Thanks very much for taking my questions.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.801, 'pos': 0.199, 'compound': 0.9665}"
1084,"Hi. Good morning.Good morning. Hi. I had two questions. One just on deposits. I know that you spent quite a bit of time going through on page 7, the growth rates there. Could you give us a little bit of color around how you're driving that increase in deposit growth, given that your deposit yields are not the highest on the Street? You've got a veryefficient deposit franchise. So just wanted to dig into that. As well as on the Global Banking side, the increase in deposits, would you deem this to be operating or non-operating? Just wondering.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.852, 'pos': 0.148, 'compound': 0.9211}"

1086,"Okay. So then just my last question here is on – the LCR ticked down very slightly from like 122 to 120 and if the Global Banking is not driving that, what was driving the slight tick-down that you had in LCR ratio this quarter?Okay. Thanks.","{'neg': 0.055, 'neu': 0.803, 'pos': 0.143, 'compound': 0.5401}"
1087,"Hi. Good morning. Brian, you guys delivered on the expense numbers again this quarter and the commitment to keep the expenses flat at $53.5 billion for two more years is impressive. I know I've asked you this before, I'd love to hear it again. You've come so far on improving efficiency already and you're doing a lot of investing as you detailed on slide 4. So how do you do all that, the modernization, the build-out, the expansion and then also keep expenses flat for two years?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.808, 'pos': 0.192, 'compound': 0.9573}"
1088,"Okay. And just a quick follow-up to that. I know you don't have a formal goal on this metric but you printed anefficiency ratio of 57% this quarter. If you continue to deliver that positive operating leverage into next year and2020, which seems likely, is there any reason it shouldn't aspire to kind of get to that mid-50s over time on that metric?Okay. Thanks.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.85, 'pos': 0.15, 'compound': 0.8807}"
1089,"Hi. Just a follow-up to that last question. So I know, John asked a question, said, if you get better revenue growth, are you committing or do you expect to have higher revenues in 2019 and 2020?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.82, 'pos': 0.18, 'compound': 0.7003}"
1090,"Okay. So flat expenses with higher revenues for the next two years. I guess, one reason that you just mentioned for that is digital banking. If 26 million mobile banking users, what's the total size of the market? What percent of the market do you have in mobile banking?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.954, 'pos': 0.046, 'compound': 0.3094}"
1091,"That'd be great. And as far as the new markets, can you remind us what are your four new markets and the five new markets yet to come?Okay. And then I guess, my main…Salt Lake City? Okay. So, why now? Seems like everybody is engaging the national digital banking wars at the same time, and so you're not alone in some of this expansion. I guess, your advantage – your consumerefficiency ratio this quarter, if I'm looking at this right, was 46%. So maybe that is your advantage. So, I guess why are you expanding in all these new markets de novo now? And are you doing enough to press your advantage if you are indeed more efficient than others?","{'neg': 0.027, 'neu': 0.8, 'pos': 0.173, 'compound': 0.9465}"

1093,"Hey, good morning. Maybe just a quick question on just sort of consumer spend, on debit and credit cards, 7% growth still good, but a little bit of a deceleration from the first half and I think that your peers, we saw some acceleration in 3Q. Is there anything to read into that in terms of the consumer activity in your cards?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.878, 'pos': 0.122, 'compound': 0.6705}"
1094,"Yeah. The hurricane's a good point. Maybe a quick question on just sort of asset liability management. Justthinking through on the securities portfolio, yields are kind of slowly grinding higher, but obviously, it's a little bit of a longer duration portfolio. It's sort of taking its hit on OCI. I think right now, yield's right around where the one year treasury is. I mean how do we think about that duration and an ability to kind of maybe more quickly reinvest at higher rates or how do we think about that?You see you're shortening that over time though.[ph] Maturities (55:02).Okay. Great. Thanks.","{'neg': 0.014, 'neu': 0.791, 'pos': 0.195, 'compound': 0.9575}"
1095,"Good morning.I was wondering if you could talk about the outlook for net interest income dollars, just given a little bit of a backup and long rates. I mean you did just comment that it takes a lot of work to sell through but obviously, that's an incremental positive, the continued kind of steady march up and short-term rates should continue to be a positive, and it sounds like you're optimistic about loans continuing to grow. So maybe just give us a little outlook on the net interest income dollars the next few quarters or however you want to frame that.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.774, 'pos': 0.226, 'compound': 0.9761}"

1097,"Okay. And then just a little bit related. As we think about the NIM percentage, obviously, nice increase thisquarter. I think you're past some of the drags as we think year-over-year in terms of the international cardbusiness, it was dragging the first half of the year. Should that trend up as well? I know there's also been some drag from markets for you and for others, but is your best guess the NIM percent would trend up as well?Okay. All right. That's all helpful. Thank you.","{'neg': 0.029, 'neu': 0.767, 'pos': 0.204, 'compound': 0.9506}"
1098,"Good morning. I just want to follow up on some of the comments you made on loan growth and I hear you on high competition, good capital markets, non-bank lenders, corporates flushed with cash. What I didn't hear is anything about – from the competition on aggressive pricing or loosening of terms. So wonder if you could address if you're seeing that and particularly from the non-bank lending side because there has been a lot more talk about that lately? Thanks.","{'neg': 0.019, 'neu': 0.831, 'pos': 0.15, 'compound': 0.875}"
1099,[indiscernible] (01:01:43). Okay. I get your responsible growth mantra and I think your shareholders will love that over time. But do you see cracks in the armour in terms of – is that just a return on investment that you're not willing to go down the path or do you think there is some irresponsible growth going on?,"{'neg': 0.063, 'neu': 0.785, 'pos': 0.152, 'compound': 0.3506}"
1100,"Loud and clear, appreciate that. Little quickly on DCM. You mentioned part of it related to slower advisory quarter. Rates, competition, tax cuts are there too.

1101,"Hi. Good morning. Can you quantify the impact of the lower provisions for representations and warranties andyeah, sale of the consumer real estate portfolio in All Other? Should we just look at the sort of sequential andyear-on-year change in revenues in All Other which is something maybe I heard of, I think, $300 million to $400 million and kind of estimate that that's more or less the size of the impact?","{'neg': 0.03, 'neu': 0.925, 'pos': 0.045, 'compound': 0.264}"
1102,"Okay. Right. So I'm just trying to get out. I know it bounces around, it's volatile. I'm just trying to get out what – I wouldn't call it a more normalized figure, would be to just – trying to clear out some of the noise to kind of gauge where we should be thinking that line could go. But okay. And I guess to change gears a little bit where are you in your CECL preparations? And when could we expect to see a more formal estimate of what the financial impact could be?Okay. All right. Thanks a lot.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.898, 'pos': 0.102, 'compound': 0.8321}"
1103,"Good morning. Want to talk about, first, asset yields, and earning asset yields were up 11 basis points. [ph] There looked (01:07:50) to be some noise in the other earning assets this particular quarter. It was up 55 basis points. So just curious what was driving that big increase this particular quarter.Other earning assets sequentially was up 55 basis points. So I was just curious why that was up so much this particular quarter.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.761, 'pos': 0.239, 'compound': 0.9438}"
1104,"Okay. And then in consumer loans, you've been going up about 6 basis points per quarter over the last threequarters leading up to this quarter. Now, it was up 16 basis points. So it looked like there was another kind ofstep-up in consumer loans, which I thought may have been maybe something in the consumer loan portfolio as well.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.839, 'pos': 0.161, 'compound': 0.8467}"
1105,"Which is good [ph] in a sense since (01:09:10) earning asset yields are moving up faster which is what we'dexpect to happen at this particular point of the interest rate cycle as you're beginning to re-price some of thelonger term assets as well as the short term assets, if we actually equate that to what's happening on the interestbearing deposit rates, you're only up a little bit less than 50% deposit beta this particular quarter.But if you take into account your funding which borrowings [ph] has a (01:09:40) little bit more of a fixed rate as well as non-interest-bearing funds, you really have the headroom with how far earning assets are going up at 10 or 11 basis points per quarter or per rate hike to increase interest-bearing deposit rates somewhere between 85% and 95% before you see really see any pressure on net interest margins.So it seems like there's some headroom that still see margins expand even though we're seeing deposit ratesmove up and just wanted to see what you thought about that threshold calculation.No. And I thought the highlight of transactions account growing was very important, and the only reason I wasasking is, there's so much consternation about what margins are going to start to go down as interest rates are moving up and deposit rates are finally starting to increase. What investors I think are missing is there's a lot of headroom to still kind of trickle up those deposit rates and still continue to improve net interest margin.Thanks.","{'neg': 0.017, 'neu': 0.817, 'pos': 0.166, 'compound': 0.9867}"

How are you?You have worked very diligently with your team since 2010, bringing Bank of America to this level of profitability that you've reported today, 123 basis points on assets and an ROE of 11%. What do you think – I know you're not at your optimum mix in terms of your balance sheet. What do you think – how much higher can you go, whether it's ROA or ROE? Is this a bank that can do 140 basis points on assets or is that just way too optimistic?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.909, 'pos': 0.091, 'compound': 0.7461}"
1107,"Very good. And then following up on a comment you made a moment ago, obviously, national interstate banking changed the lay of the land to the banks, your deposit market share is over the 10% level that prohibits a bank from making depository acquisitions. Clearly, you're going with the organic growth strategy as you pointed out.As we look out into the future, assuming you're not allowed to do a depository acquisition, should we look at your return of excess capital consistently to be between 70% and 80% indefinitely out into the future? 70%, 80% of earnings that is.Great.

1108,"Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. My first one is on deposits. They have been definitely in focus for the Wealth Management side and I know you gave some comments on that, Jon, thanks for that. But we had the first wave, I believe, of CDs – your CD program that was scheduled to mature over this summer.

1109,"Terrific. Thanks for that. And then on the equity side, you guys – the trends and the share gains have been really impressive.

1110,"Okay, good. Just could you elaborate a little bit more on the deposit strategy and growth? And it just seems to be getting a little bit more competitive with more of the banks pursuing a national digital banking strategy. What are you seeing and at what point would you pivot your strategy based on what you're seeing?And then a separate question. I don't recall, do you disclose a net interest margin? And if you do, what has it done and what do you expect it to do?And then just one follow-up. That's interesting about the cash levels from 8% to 10% down to 6%.

1111,"Revenue, obviously, was strong this quarter. It's been strong year-to-date. It sounds like it's off to a good start this quarter. But if you look at the stock, it's, obviously, been under a lot of pressure this year and, I think, it's concern over the sustainability of revenue.

1112,"Thank you. And I think the other concern, obviously, is the capital deployment and the results from 2018 CCAR. But it seems like you're addressing that or trying to building capital. I don't know if that was simply the – what's going on in the market or specifically response to the CCAR results, if you could comment on that.

One of your peers highlighted the increased competitive environment in ISG, I think specifically in the [ph] SIC (00:27:25) with tighter spreads. I don't know, can you let us know what you're seeing? Is this just the usual strong players just competing more aggressively, given the lower volatility, or are you seeing some more – like reinvigorated competition from maybe the European peers?","{'neg': 0.054, 'neu': 0.76, 'pos': 0.185, 'compound': 0.8895}"

Considering 45% is in fee-based accounts and your lending efforts, your deposit efforts, the comp trends, the only offset I see is the lower transactions.

It appears to us that one of the big concerns is your higher sensitivity to movement in equity markets and equity market declines, which certainly comes to mind, given the latest move. I was hoping you can give us some insight about how you think about earnings resiliency in a sustained market correction.

It seems like the Street is contemplating some revenue growth from here in line with GDP, but numbers suggest that there is some skepticism that that will translate into positive operating leverage.

Maybe just following-up James on the stability of earnings and revenue and how thattranslates to capital, because I think, I guess, one of the issues I've struggled with – I think investors havestruggled with is, you have sort of the biggest drop in the stress test in CET1, and that obviously could have an impact if and when we move to the SCB.

If I could just maybe ask one thing, unrelated to capital, just on the – I think there's been a lot of concern about NII growth from here.

I know some of the things you've highlighted are gaining more wallet from existing customers in the high net worth channel, which are obviously growing; expanding relationships with younger customers through technology; and then marketing to the stock plan participants. So I'd just love if you could maybe touch on all those channels in terms of the longer-term potential and any anecdotes that maybe is making you feel good about where you are with some of the newer initiatives, like the younger customers or penetrating kind of the stock plan, just as I'm assuming that's where we'll see growth accelerate as well.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.783, 'pos': 0.217, 'compound': 0.9785}"

Clearly, credit quality across the banking industry is very strong today. Your consumer WealthManagement area, high-quality, you don't have much trading risk any more with the VaR being where it is. Butwhat are you guys seeing or what are your folks telling you, that they're seeing in the so-called shadow banking sector, the leverage lending area?

So I apologize, but you had aslide that talked about Consumer and Corporate balance sheets being in great shape and having a low debtservice burden. The 10 years' up a modest 35 basis points since then and the world's freaking out that it's the endof the cycle and that's going to choke off the recovery. Your results are your results, but they're, some will say,backward-looking. Are you seeing any impact, A, at the modest increase in the curve now? And B, I'll ask again,is there a level of rates where you would start to see an impact of slowdown in what you're willing to lend, rising incredit costs, things like that?

I know you've given some helpfulguidance in terms of the impact of Fed QE unwind as well in the past.

1144,"Just wanted to follow up on the question on operating leverage. How should we think about the outlook forpositive operating leverage, which is more philosophically because your efficiency ratio is currently not materiallyabove the 55% through the cycle expectation?

1145,"Got it. Okay. Fair enough. And then if I could just ask a quick follow-up on CECL, I know you don't manage theaccounting outcomes and I think, Marianne, you mentioned a number of areas last quarter where CECL couldhave an impact.

The second question is when we look at the weekly H8 data on Friday's, the smallerbanks in this country are growing their loan books much faster than the larger banks. You obviously had goodloan growth this quarter, but it doesn't match up to what the smaller banks are producing. So the question is whatimpact do you think the CCAR process has had on you when you compare your underwriting pre-financial crisis? Iknow you're not changing your underwriting standards. But do you think the larger banks are more conservativeas a general statement?

1153,"Okay. That's what I would say. So let's go to the next questions. Given the rates have been low for so long, goingup until we started increasing rates, we've repriced almost every security and loan we had on the books. So theactual upward potential to reprice portfolio yields to current market rates has got to be larger than what we wouldtypically have seen historically.

1154,"Yes. So the stretch between just portfolio yields, so asset yields can actually reprice faster than what we've seenhistorically. So the combination of those two things, in our estimation, gives us a threshold. So if we solvebackwards for deposit betas, it gives us a threshold, if we estimate for JPMorgan, of somewhere between 80% to90% deposit betas before you actually kind of break through and start eroding net interest margin. Currently youhad about a 40% deposit beta this quarter. So you have a lot of headroom still to go before margins start to reallyerode given deposit pricing.
