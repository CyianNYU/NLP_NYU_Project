0,"Marianne, I was just wondering. I know you’ll give us more at Investor Day. But just in terms of that first quarter starting point for NII and just how it translates between growth in the balance sheet, and then you mentioned the benefit from the rollover in rates, can you help us just try to think about how you parse those views out and think about volume vs. rate?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.854, 'pos': 0.146, 'compound': 0.899}"
1,"Understood, great. And if I could ask a follow-up, just on the volume side, you had another great year of double-digit loan growth. And obviously, we’re at this intersection between what was and then what will be. Any change to that expectation that you could just grow the loan book, core loan book that is, as strongly as you have in the past three years?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.821, 'pos': 0.179, 'compound': 0.9169}"
2,"I just wanted to dig in a little bit on the forward look NII up a bit, but also expenses up a bit, and I just wanted to understand. Is that because you’ve got the opportunity to reinvest in things that you haven’t been able to? And if you could, just speak to what kind of timeframe the reinvestment will yield returns because the question I’ve gotten from people is why aren’t you dropping the NII benefit to the bottom line here.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.907, 'pos': 0.093, 'compound': 0.8271}"
3,"And then the related follow-up has to do with how you’re thinking about the excess cash you’ve got and the balance sheet duration, and if there’s anything in this new interest rate environment that you would be seeking to do to optimize your position. So no change to the duration?","{'neg': 0.051, 'neu': 0.838, 'pos': 0.111, 'compound': 0.5161}"
4,"I was wondering if you could comment a little bit about some more color in Card trends. You have exciting new products out there.

5,"Okay. And just as a follow-up on that, in terms of the card credit quality, it’s been very good. Would you still expect to see, though, some seasoning as the book matures? What kind of outlook would you have on the card charge-offs?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.829, 'pos': 0.171, 'compound': 0.7937}"
6,"I know that you’ve said previously that regulatory reform or regulatory relief will unlikely have any fundamental change in terms of how you’re thinking about budgeting, but I’m wondering if you could help us understand over the past few years, how much have regulatory costs grown?

And can you give us a sense of how that could trend over the next few years, either the natural trend of it or what the impact would be of regulatory reform?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.893, 'pos': 0.107, 'compound': 0.8552}"
7,"Great. And just as a follow-up to John’s question on Card trends, when you look at the Card revenue rate declining about 200BPS or so y-over-y, is your response to this question essentially implying that we’ve potentially hit peak promotion in 2016, and perhaps the revenue rate will have some stability to it in 2017?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.928, 'pos': 0.072, 'compound': 0.6249}"

11,"Maybe we could just talk a little bit about the Investment Bank. Obviously, your peers and a lot of investors have been growing in their optimism for this year in terms of animal spirits and everything else, and I just wanted to get a sense of how you’re thinking about it. Do you share that optimism, and any commentary on how we can think about both banking and trading into the new year with all the moving parts that we have around policy et cetera? Thanks.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.848, 'pos': 0.152, 'compound': 0.9153}"
12,"Okay, that’s helpful. And maybe as a follow-up, on the expense side, the comp ratio in the Investment Bank I think dropped around 240BPS this year or last year.

13,"Hey, Jamie, one of the things that we’re seeing some of the new politicians coming in and talking about opening up the credit box, especially in the mortgage world that has really been shut down over the last years, mainly due to the rules coming from all the things, Fannie, Freddie, CFPB. What type of things do you need to see or you think they can do to open up that credit box where banks can take more risk and be protected?","{'neg': 0.027, 'neu': 0.881, 'pos': 0.092, 'compound': 0.6915}"
14,"So I guess the question for either one of you is if we do get some lower taxes and/or a better rate environment, I’m curious on your confidence on how much of that can fall to the bottom line because there’s a lot of optimism about what can happen if stocks have moved well. We’re expecting that to move to the bottom line. The big concern that people have is that it gets competed away by irrational behavior. So I’m curious to get your thoughts on that, just big picture in general. If things go well, how much of that do you retain?","{'neg': 0.04, 'neu': 0.798, 'pos': 0.162, 'compound': 0.9169}"
15,"The real follow-up I had was the concept of interest deductibility, if that is the means that they use to pay for the tax hikes, it feels to us like a bad thing.

16,"If I can circle back to the discussion on net interest income and the rate leverage, I think the outlook for net interest income to grow over $3B vs. the $1.5B before the rate increase, that’s obviously a nice lift for just a 25 basis point bump on the short end. So I guess, one, does that include the benefit of longer-term rates since they’ve moved up as well since 9/30, which I assume it does, but just to confirm that? And then secondly, what’s the levers to rising rates from here as we think about movements on both the short and long end?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.889, 'pos': 0.111, 'compound': 0.8156}"
17,"And that’s actually going to my follow-up question. On the size of the balance sheet, you did talk about loan growth of about 10% this year. If we look full-year 2016 vs. 2015, the balance sheet or the earning assets only rose 1%. So maybe to tie that into as you think about duration the fact that you’re sitting on a lot of liquidity and cash, and how we should think about both overall growth on the balance sheet and then potentially some more remixing.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.922, 'pos': 0.078, 'compound': 0.7096}"
18,"Hey, just a quick question on the credit and the reserve release as it relates to the energy and the metals and mining portfolio.

20,"Marianne, just to follow up with a couple more questions on Card, I know you’ve talked quite a bit about it already. But one of the conventional wisdoms at the moment is that 2016 represented the pinnacle of the intensification of the competitive environment. I just wanted to get your thoughts on whether that’s an accurate assessment or not.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.963, 'pos': 0.037, 'compound': 0.2617}"
21,"Great. And just on that point, the ROA expectations that you have or the consequence of the trends you just underscored, do you consider these to be sustainable as you get back to that 11% revenue yield?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.898, 'pos': 0.102, 'compound': 0.6249}"
22,"I wanted to start off with a big picture question on the trading side. You made some recent remarks talking about the outlook for the FICC business and alluded to roughly half of the decline vs. the peak being attributable to cyclical as well as secular factors. And a lot of FICC optimists in particular that we’ve spoken with have really latched on to your remarks. And I was hoping you could provide some context as to how you determined the 50:50 split. Should we be taking those comments so literally, and how you’re thinking about the FICC fee pool trajectory overall as some of those cyclical headwinds abate?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.911, 'pos': 0.089, 'compound': 0.836}"
23,"Thanks, Jamie. That’s extremely helpful color. And, Marianne, maybe just switching over to the expense side for a moment, you also provided some very helpful detail on some of the drivers of the strong expense progress that you’ve seen in CIB in particular. And from what I recall in last year’s update, Daniel [Pinto] actually guided to an expense target of about $19B by 2017. It looks like you’ve gotten there essentially a year early. And I’m wondering whether there are more savings initiatives that have not yet been filtered through and could potentially accrete in the coming year.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.836, 'pos': 0.164, 'compound': 0.9492}"
24,"I was just wondering if we could talk a bit about Rates trading. To my mind, that was a product that has done particularly well this quarter. But I was wondering looking forward how you see that performing, whether it supports it by what’s going on in the yield curve or whether you see that supported more by one-off euphoria around the election, so maybe that might tail off a little bit. And then just leading on from that, how do you view the opportunities for growth in your capital markets businesses, your CIB vs. your lending businesses? Are you equally enthusiastic about both? And given the opportunities in that going forward, do you see something more positive than that?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.754, 'pos': 0.246, 'compound': 0.9888}"
25,"It sounds maybe you’re pressures of the year-on-year growth when you’ve got CIB business, but you’re not really highlighting that in terms of your lending businesses, which obviously you’d expect for the margins to grow there, the loan books to grow.","{'neg': 0.039, 'neu': 0.919, 'pos': 0.042, 'compound': 0.0387}"
26,"Good. Can you give us some color? In the past, you’ve talked about – in the multifamily, I know you’ve commented on that in your prepared remarks, on your multifamily book.

27,"Certainly. And, Marianne, coming back to the investment portfolio, obviously you talked a little bit about the duration. Do you have the actual duration of it in years this quarter vs. Q3?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.926, 'pos': 0.074, 'compound': 0.34}"
28,"Just a quick question for you, Marianne. In terms of the mortgage, in the overall picture I understand why you’re talking about maybe 10% core loan growth rather than 15% more recently. But just within the residential mortgage portfolio, it looks like that slowed in Q4, third and fourth quarter from a mid-teens y-over-y rate to a low single-digit q-over-q rate. Can you give us more color as to what’s going on there? Are you slowing your purchases of your own originations, or is there something else going on there?","{'neg': 0.029, 'neu': 0.911, 'pos': 0.059, 'compound': 0.4137}"
29,"The thing that jumped out at me was if you looked at the Asset Management group, you had $21B of long-term product outflows and you had $35B of liquidity products inflows. And it seems like now that we’re getting past the financial crisis when everybody was looking at liquidity, combining that with continued deposit growth, we’re not seeing a change in that perspective, but there’s still a premium for increasing liquidity still.","{'neg': 0.035, 'neu': 0.894, 'pos': 0.072, 'compound': 0.1901}"

31,"And then my last follow-up was when you look at M&A, we had M&A suppressed when things were more regulatory constrained and the outlook was a negative on the overall economy, not an uncertainty. Now we have this positive uncertainty. Wouldn’t that delay some activity for at least a couple of quarters for people to see where we’re going to end up and see where tax rates are and see what we might get a deregulation that might change their perspective on their long-term opportunities?

32,"Something you could just sort of address the – of the pace at which you would anticipate deploying liquidity favor the course of the year, can be – I guess I can get a directional sense for what you’ve been doing in the earning asset base, but just curious kind of philosophically how are you thinking about legging into higher interest rates, as we look throughout 2017?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.846, 'pos': 0.154, 'compound': 0.8608}"
33,"And then maybe skipping over to the sort of the volume side of the NII equation. I think Q1 guidance is still for more modest growth, but then you got the stronger growth outlook for the full year on overall loan growth.

34,"One on expenses. I see the 350 CIP target. Can you just talk about whether or not there’s an opportunity to drop any of that to the bottom line. I mean I saw the guidance for next year with expense expectation in the low-single-digits, but wondered if that includes the CIP, and so the result is that you’re now dropping into the bottom-line or am I misunderstanding something?But what I’m also hearing is a little bit of backend improvement expected.","{'neg': 0.084, 'neu': 0.867, 'pos': 0.049, 'compound': -0.2302}"
35,And then just secondly on the tax question. There’s obviously been a lot of chatter around potentially having a lower tax rate.

And where you think that natural resting ground will be as DOL may be coming into play in a couple of months?While we're on that topic, let's just say that DOL goes as planned, meaning there's no dilution, there's no delay, the April 10 deadline – is that an event that changes behavior ahead of it on this fee-based discussion?

So I get it that there's some uncertainty in the rev environment, but you guys highlighted it seems like momentum continues to improve. Specifically, FICC looks stable, exceeding targets with lower capital, equity is strong, NII's starting to benefit from rate uplift and risk appetite is an expanding and transactional revenues are starting to improve in Wealth Management. And then finally, we've got the outlook for potential changes from a new administration that's highlighted regulation and the desire to cut back. So in light of all of that, how should we think about the ROE guide? It certainly seems like the low end given those factors would be quite easy for you.

I think you did something along those lines in the 1Q fixed income presentation last year, so perhaps you can give an update on that?

How do you get common equity to go up?But if interest rates keep rising and if the impact is similar to what you saw in the fourth quarter, your common equity's going to continue to flow. And if your common equity continues to flow, in answer to an earlier question, you indicated that you'd be able to expand the size of the balance sheet to take advantage of new opportunities. But you won't be able to do that if you can't get common equity to stabilize or rise in a rising interest rate environment. In other words, you may be able to get an increased benefit in terms of asset sensitivity from some of your business lines.

And those impacts that you flag relate to timing DTA specifically, and I wanted to better understand how the foreign tax credits might be affected.

85,Hi. And it's just a clarification question. You mentioned that the base upon which you were giving your outlook had no further rate hikes contemplated. I just want to make sure that the mid-50s efficiency ratio guidance for 2018 reflects the maturity of your investments.

88,"Okay. My second question is just on credit. If you do have this improving efficiency ratio out there, it does presume also that you talked about the card loss expectations for this year, but just a broader question on credit in general.

89,"Hi. Good morning. John, I just wanted to clarify the outlook for the net interest income dollars that you gave. It sounded like maybe looking at a net-net growth of about $1.2 billion in 2017. Did I hear that right? And would that be assuming no more right hikes?Okay. That's Citicorp, just year-on-year, 2017 versus 2016. And should we just about that as Group now?

90,"Got it. Very clear. Thank you. Just a question on the DTA, John: what were the dynamics of the DTA progress in the fourth quarter? There was an OCI impact it looked like.

91,"My question relates to your targets and accountability to those targets. The short question is what are your targets for 2017 for ROA and ROE? And the longer version is in three parts. Number one would be the timeframe. Thank you for giving us the ROTCE target of 10% by late 2019 without any DTA write down. But from our perspective, you missed the ROE target that you had from a few years ago.Now you have to carry more capital, so there's a story there. But you missed the efficiency target from last January. Now you revised that in April, you made a revised target but there's a story there. And then you missed the ROA target of 90 to 110 basis points. So after missed targets this decade from our shareholder perspective, now we have to wait another two and a half years to see if you achieve your targets and it just seems like not enough accountability in the short term for 2017.The second question, does relate to the ROA. Can you commit to an ROA of 90 to 110 basis points in 2017? And last year in the first three minutes of this call, you highlighted how you met that target, which was good, and now in 2016 it's down to 82 basis point and you don't mention that you missed the ROA target. You don't mention it anywhere on this conference call and you don't mention it anywhere in the 89 pages that were released today. Then the third question is ROE. What is your ROE target for 2017? Again, this is down to 7.6% ROTCE. That's down from 9.2% in 2017. And after it's gotten worse, you now say excludes the DTA impact, and that would boost it to 9%. I'd say there's no credible accounting theory that would permit the exclusion of the DTA capital. If that was the case you should have taken reserve but let's go with the 9%. That's still worst in class so again, waiting two and a half years seems like a long time if we wanted to hold you accountable.So the timeframe, waiting another two and a half years after missed targets, the ROA target, where do you expect that to be in 2017? And what kind of ROE target can we have in 2017? And what I'm really getting at, if you were on the outside trying to hold you accountable, how would you want us to hold you accountable in 2017? What specific metrics after what shareholders have been through?","{'neg': 0.073, 'neu': 0.87, 'pos': 0.057, 'compound': -0.8796}"

So what gives you the confidence that you really are turning the corner there in terms of regaining share, regaining business momentum and really closing the profitability gap, so to speak, with some of your peers?

And what I’m wondering is if interest expense deductibility is in fact eliminated, we do see reduced appetite from debt from corporates.

169,"Paul, I was wondering if you could give us a little more split of some of the drivers of the net interest income increase that you're expecting to occur between the fourth and the first quarter, the $600 million. How much is that is driven by the Fed hike we saw on the short-end? And how much of it might be the long-end in rates versus loan growth?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.884, 'pos': 0.116, 'compound': 0.8053}"

171,"Okay, got it. That's helpful, and then a question for Brian on capital return and CCAR. Some of the other banks have used the de minimis exception to top off their 2016 CCAR authorizations. That leaves Bank of America standing out quite a bit on the low end of payouts versus peers. So I'm wondering, two questions. One, how do you guys think about that de minimis? You did well in 2016. Any reason that Bank of America couldn't think about the de minimis top-off? Are there restrictions on that, or could you do that at some point this year on the de minimis? And then second, as you move into 2017, what are your goals to get your capital distributions closer to peer payouts, and why wouldn't you be able to do that? Thanks.And that will take you through – just as a reminder, Paul, that will take you through the end of the CCAR period, right?","{'neg': 0.013, 'neu': 0.927, 'pos': 0.06, 'compound': 0.755}"

176,"Yes, super, ROA and ROE is supportive anyway for the overall company.

How do you again manage the expense along the way?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.815, 'pos': 0.185, 'compound': 0.9215}"
177,"So, Paul, I wanted to start off with a question on the FICC business. The revenues have been remarkably resilient over the last couple of years, really helped by some of the factors that you cited, whether it be strong risk discipline, balance sheet management, and the reduction in VaR. But as we look ahead, what we've been hearing from a lot of folks is growing optimism around the FICC business in the coming year.

178,"And switching over to just the capital side for a moment, you highlighted the progress you made in reducing the G-SIB surcharge $2.5 billion, and I'm wondering. As you think about how you're going to allocate capital across the different businesses, whether that positions you to reduce your firm-wide targets and maybe more specifically, how are you thinking about your spot capital requirement today for the firm overall?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.959, 'pos': 0.041, 'compound': 0.4215}"

183,"Yeah, that's good to hear. Other question was just on the improvement in the minimum capital ratio and the RWA reduction that drove that.

184,"Thank you. When you think about rate sensitivity and deposit betas, you get back to really deposit flows. We continue to see increases in deposit balances, and until we see any pressure of those balances being kind of deployed back into the economy, there really shouldn't be much impact on pricing.

It would be nice to have that metric or more color or just anything else you can give along those lines. And maybe just for some more of that color, the efficiency ratio, I get it. You've gotten better but it's still not where I think you want to be, 66%. And your peers today that reported are under 60% for last year.

194,"Hey, thank you very much and good quarter, guys. Talking about mortgage banking a little bit, you talked about that you did about $22 billion in originations in the quarter. Correct me if I'm wrong, Brian, but did you mention that you portfolioed three-quarters of that onto the portfolio?

197,"Okay. And then separately, credit quality overall is very good, the charge-offs, the non-performers. You did flag the – I think it's the non-guaranteed consumer early delinquencies.

208,"Thank you, John and James, for having the call. It's been extremely helpful for us. A broader question to start with, Citi's revenues have somewhat lagged the broader global systemically important banks.

210,"And thanks for doing the call and the information. Couple of questions. One, on slide 27, on the OCI, you've laid out pretty well the impact of interest rates changes last quarter on net interest margin, and potential impacts for future shifts in the curve.

212,"Okay. And then my last one, just generally on Mexico and the Mexican business, we've seen obviously, get a lot of attention with the new administration.

213,"Just wondering if you could talk about how you think about the composition on the size of your balance sheet if and when the Fed changes its balance sheet and it kind of takes out some of the excess reserves from the system and you may see some deposit outflows? Does that mean that you have to change course in terms of protecting the LCR and maybe then kind of pressuring the regulators to change what's eligible in the LCR calculations?And within the model then the way you maintain the value of the deposits in the LCR, is it true showing that they are sticky, that you pay a higher rate to retain them?

214,"Thank you. Further to Rob's question about the Mexican franchise, you've mentioned in the past you want to reinvest in the business, the $1 billion and through that period of time you're going to create positive operating leverage which suggests that it's going to be self-funding. And I guess the question is, is there going to be more investment on the retail side of the business which is much smaller than the corporate business that you have?

217,"Great, thanks. Thanks for the helpful call. So you have a peer that has the same credit ratings as you. About six months ago they announced a cost cutting program and recently Moody's changed their rating outlook on that peer to positive, citing the outlook for profitability has improved. And then recently you've announced a target to cut your expense ratio for 2017. Do you think you can make solid progress on hitting your efficiency ratio target over the next six months? Or will the improvement happen more in the second half of the year?Okay, great. And then yes, as you mentioned you hit your 2016 efficiency ratio target. But I guess arguably the revenue environment, at least on the trading side, improved more than expected in the second half of the year. So if revenue for the second half of 2016 didn't improve, what levers would you have had to hit the efficiency ratio target last year?","{'neg': 0.047, 'neu': 0.745, 'pos': 0.208, 'compound': 0.9708}"
218,"Okay, great. Thanks John. And then maybe for James, on the TLAC slide on page 14, previously you had excluded the customer related debt discounting for TLAC. So what kind of changed your mind in saying that the $26 billion, maybe $6 billion would count as TLAC? And maybe is this another source of potential issuance for this kind of security for TLAC purposes?Okay, so would there be continued issuance of this type of security?

222,"Right. No, that's right. Yeah.

225,"Thanks guys for holding the call, always good. My question is going back on to the final TLAC rules. I'm sorry to beat a dead horse here…I still like to beat it. When we think about the indentures, the old versus the new, and then versus existing subordinated indenture, how should we really be thinking about this from just a bankruptcy scenario, taking FDIC potential off the table? But I kind of struggle to look at what the actual difference is between subordinated indenture and the new senior indenture?

229,"Thank you so much for having the call. I really appreciate it. A couple of questions for you. As you think about 2017 issuance, I think you had $25 billion on page 10.

I think most banks in general were not hitting that given TLAC uncertainty.","{'neg': 0.036, 'neu': 0.882, 'pos': 0.082, 'compound': 0.4754}"
230,"Okay, great. And then given the callability notes that had been coming out with all the institutions, I guess my big question there would be how do you view that call?

I think there's two schools of thoughts in terms of growth prospects.

Can you give us a sense of what you expect in terms of the glide path of that number, how that can progress over H2, and ultimately what kind of yield you can get in your branded cards portfolio? And then on the credit quality in the branded cards, I think you mentioned Costco collections changed the collection process, seasoning and whatnot influencing the numbers this quarter. And you had about $633mm of net credit losses in branded cards, which was a big increase vs. Q1 and Q3. I guess it’s fair to say that that’s sort of abnormally high, and we should expect that run rate to normalize at a lower level in the coming quarters.

I’m guessing that that constraint weighed somewhat on your revenues relative to if you hadn’t had to have that constraint.

And you kind of implied there were some other expenses, but I’m just wondering if you can kind of aggregate all in as you think about the drag to profitability that you’re experiencing now.

The existing customer base seems to be performing well. We can look at your credit card balances overall, the fee revenues. So I think part of the thesis on the stock would be that you’re under-earning now because of some of these issues impacting both revenue and expenses.

But I just wanted to get a sense: when you guys look at the business and the mix, are you positioned where you want to be? And then when we think about that in terms of the outlook, is there more that can be done on the expense or capital base?

I believe, as I recall, there was some market-making conditions that were tricky which certainly, we can understand but we didn't have that this quarter.Everybody else's or a lot of your money center peers here have reported pretty solid both quarter over quarter and year-over-year. I get it that commodities is a laggard, but is there anything further? Does it have to do with corporate client base being relatively smaller? Does it have to do with retaining some holding back on some capital because you want to have dry powder for an improving environment?

381,"Okay. That's fair. Thanks for that and the patience with the whatever, fifth question on it. Following up, though, on the component there. A couple years ago, you guys had made the effort to try to grow out the corporate client base. Is that still an effort that you guys are focused on?

382,"Okay. Okay. That's fair. Last one for me.

383,"Hey. Okay. So [indiscernible] question on the fixing, and I'm just going to follow up on a comment that you made, which is we heard several times that, obviously, clients were less active, and that has lots to do with mix, and it makes sense, but I think I also heard you say that you didn't feel like you had navigated some of the current as effectively as you might have, and I was wondering if you could break down between the areas that you called out as having been headwinds, which were commodities FX, and I think to a lesser extent credit. Where, in particular, maybe there were issues with inventory management, or positioning, as opposed to just the customer flow?Okay.

384,"Okay. And then just changing to follow up to one of the other questions that has arisen a couple of times on the comp accrual, just trying to do a little math around it. If I take that 1 percentage point and I apply it to the $8 billion of revenue run rate that, as you point out, is kind of have been the stable number for the last four quarters. I get a little over $300 million. Is it fake math or good math to kind of compare that $300 million, $320 million to the $900 million of costs saved and think that the message you're sending is that maybe a third, or so, of that $900 million is on the comp line?","{'neg': 0.025, 'neu': 0.886, 'pos': 0.089, 'compound': 0.7184}"
385,"Okay. Fair enough. And then just on that same point, last year you came in at 38.1% comp ratio for the full year…And all else equal, should we think about modeling that ratio down close to a hundred basis points based on the signal that you sent with the reduction for 1Q and just the thought that usually you apply that same ratio in the second quarter?

386,"Just maybe a follow up on the expense side. As you mentioned there's a lot of discussion with a turtle [ph] talking about maybe phasing out the qualitative aspect of CCAR, simplification of Volcker. How do we think about the impact on expenses? Is that a material kind of annual thing that if we see those things go way that can be quite helpful?

So I'm just curious how the current moratorium on new regulation is impacting sentiment at all internally. Essentially, is it freeing up management to focus on other business opportunities or maybe increase risk appetite to do something new?

They’re coming up actually for you and others, which is definitely expected at this point in the cycle, but I guess order of magnitude might be a little more than I would have anticipated.

794,"Okay, all right. Thank you. And then maybe switching gears a little. So your balances on deposits in the Fed I think are the lowest they’ve been in the last few years.

796,"Okay. And then expenses. Obviously, Rob, you pointed to operating leverage. You’re definitely growing revenues far faster than expenses, and this year you did pivot a little bit away from just focusing on dollars of expenses as opposed to just the leverage and the efficiency ratio. So I just wondered if you can kind of help us understand pacing? Revenue is good, so expenses are higher but expense growth was 5% y-over-y. The timing of just your investments vs. your saves and all of those structured programs that you’d walked us through in the last couple of months, can you just give us an update on that?","{'neg': 0.02, 'neu': 0.858, 'pos': 0.122, 'compound': 0.8183}"

800,"Okay. Good. And then just lastly, Bill. I mean, you guys have done a phenomenal job on the acquisitions of Nat City and Riggs National and RBC. The markets have certainly changed now and you’ve been very disciplined in the way you approach acquisitions. If you look out over the next two to three years, do you envision CCAR to CCAR banks combining? These are banks with over $50B in assets combining maybe with $200B bank, and what’s your view on where PNC would fit into that process?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.873, 'pos': 0.127, 'compound': 0.8677}"

806,"Okay, thanks. And then have you guys given any color on how much of the growth – you talked about the broad-based growth and taking share on the commercial lending side.

807,"I’m just wondering if I could ask about capital maybe longer term. So I think, and correct me if I’m misstating this, but I think when you’ve talked about the big picture for you guys on capital, it’s been somewhere in 8s as a CET1 target, but the challenge getting there has always been the CCAR partly because of the process and partly because the tendency to outperform your budget or your capital plan, which we see with earnings as well. So I realize the Treasury white papers, and it’s not even really in proposal stage. It’s just like a broad recommendation stage. But just conceptually if CCAR did change, if buybacks and balance sheet growth were a lesser part of the process or not a part of the process at all, you really don’t lose money even in a severely adverse scenario. So how would that change your thinking or the timing around your excess capital position?","{'neg': 0.068, 'neu': 0.852, 'pos': 0.081, 'compound': 0.033}"

812,"Got it. Got it. Okay. And just thinking about – I know you guys haven’t been giving the updated purchase accounting accretion. I know at the end of the year, you talked about expected...I know. Sorry about that, but the margin has been good even with the headwind where you guys have talked about the $75mm expected drop. So I just wonder is it still on pace? Is this what you guys have expected?Got it. Okay. So if we’re thinking, of the $278mm last year, in H1 the year you’re on $140mm. That’s about…A little less than that.Got you.

813,"No one asked you a kind of a bigger picture question. When you talk about going into markets, I mean, the Southeast was a market where you did have an acquisition and some presence, and now you’re going into markets where you don’t have that. The competition or the competitive advantage that you bring to the table, what are a couple of those things that gives you the confidence that you can go in and win business from folks that are have been sitting in those markets over time?","{'neg': 0.024, 'neu': 0.859, 'pos': 0.117, 'compound': 0.8225}"
814,"Thanks. And then, Rob, when we look at the credit, the biggest question we still push back is we’re far along in this recovery and long in the tooth. It’s been eight years, so the credit cycle has to turn. Our numbers show that when we look at the monitor, the R index, that we’re slowly navigating back to neutral, but there isn’t really any pressure. You’re showing that in your credit numbers. Non-performers continuing to improve, you’re still providing less and you have a net charge-off. So what are the tenets right now that should also give us some confidence, which we believe is there, that credit should stay stable to historically low for the next 12 to 18 months?","{'neg': 0.058, 'neu': 0.774, 'pos': 0.168, 'compound': 0.9358}"
815,"And you can’t really just migrate to the average even though we’re kind of neutralizing that. Neutralization is probably in 10 to 15 to maybe even 20BPS, but not a real step-up in the sense of credit costs or provisioning given that I think there has been constraints in the industry that have caused the books to be a little bit stronger.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.899, 'pos': 0.101, 'compound': 0.7493}"
816,"Just regarding the loan growth, just wanted to get a little bit more color there, in terms of your mid single-digit expectation. I mean, what’s really helping you buck the trend that we’re seeing here in the industry? Are you seeing some of that softening at all in certain areas where it’s definitely evident?

817,"Okay. Got it. Thanks, Bill.

819,"Just on the outlook on loan growth, in terms of your reply to John’s question, it seems like its PNC’s consistent strategy that really drove the outperformance especially in commercial this quarter.

822,"All right. And just as a follow-up, just on underwriting standards in general, we look at the Senior Loan Officer Survey and you could see the industry, there are some tightening going on, particularly I think, in CRE.

828,"Bill and Rob, I was wondering if I can follow-up a little bit on Bill’s kind of initial comments on the switchover to using swaps vs. securities based on kind of where the curve is and what you’re seeing in terms of the incremental opportunity. So, do you have a lot more capability to continue to add to the swaps book? And just, in terms of, you know, are new swaps better vs. securities at this point?

829,"Okay. And then, so does that presume – we see all of that coming still through. Do we see that coming through the securities yield? Or do we also see it coming on the liability side? Just in terms of how we watch that going forward, right. It’s a little tricky to kind of see that forward in terms of how that shows through the NIM?Right. So, I guess to sum that all up, is it fair to say that just from the combination of higher rates and some of that you should still expect to see dollars of interest income generated from the securities book rise from here?","{'neg': 0.027, 'neu': 0.863, 'pos': 0.11, 'compound': 0.8574}"
830,"Maybe just to riff on the idea of deposit beta, and you mentioned the difference in performance between retail and commercial. But I guess I’m curious, are you seeing any meaningful difference in the deposit beta performance in your newer markets than you are in your more legacy PNC markets? And I guess I’m asking because of the market share differential there could cause you a little bit different performance in terms of deposit beta.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.888, 'pos': 0.112, 'compound': 0.8271}"
831,"Fair enough. And then, for my follow-up, just a question on utilization. I just want to make sure I heard you correctly, Rob, in terms of the utilization rates on the commercial business have been pretty flat. And I guess, I’m curious, if that’s just – is that more people coming in and looking for lines as well as more people borrowing or can you give a little more color behind the dynamics of the flat utilization rate?","{'neg': 0.043, 'neu': 0.769, 'pos': 0.187, 'compound': 0.8402}"
832,"Regarding your auto book, I noticed that the ending balance is down slightly, but your average balance is up fairly healthy. Was there a specific movement later in the quarter that would have caused auto to slow significantly ending down, given your acceleration in Q4?Great.

834,"I guess just a quick follow-up. On the securities yields, thinking about where that Q1 2017 yield is for total securities.

835,"Yeah. Exactly, exactly. Thanks for the color Bill. I guess maybe other question, a follow-up on that is, as you mentioned end of period balances at the Fed went up.

836,"I appreciate that. And maybe just one last – somewhat housekeeping question for you Rob, on the tax.The tax rate. There was – I know you guys talked about in the 10-K, the change in accounting on the RSUs. I mean, what was that impact to the actual tax benefit you had in Q1 on a dollar basis?$25mm. And in theory, I mean so that there was kind of – that benefit used to be in other compounds of income previously, but now I mean, it comes with Q1 when you usually have more of the option grants, right, the RSU grants, so next quarter you’d see that benefit go away.","{'neg': 0.021, 'neu': 0.849, 'pos': 0.13, 'compound': 0.882}"
837,"Good morning. So I definitely heard all the commentary on FICC, and I think commodities is one of the things that stands out, that makes you different than the others. But maybe we could talk about mix of clients and how much that adds to maybe the differentiated performance that we're seeing, meaning you seem more volatility-dependent, right? We've talked about it in the past. And when vol is low, your revenues struggle more than others. Is there anything that Goldman can do to broaden the mix of both clients and products to be less volatility-dependent? In the past, you had a relationship with Sumitomo that brought a bigger lending mix. I'm just thinking out loud.","{'neg': 0.051, 'neu': 0.916, 'pos': 0.033, 'compound': -0.4613}"
838,"Maybe the related follow-up is more cyclical than that structural piece. I guess I scratch my head at times and say why is volatility so low. Like, theoretically, we've been waiting for this inflection point for the U.S. to be off QE to start raising rates which is different than what's going on in Europe and Asia. You've had some currency movement, some commodity movement. You would've thought this would've been a better volatile backdrop and people would've wanted your liquidity, but it's not happening.Are we hooked on idiosyncratic events and actually these asset class moves aren't good enough?","{'neg': 0.048, 'neu': 0.883, 'pos': 0.069, 'compound': 0.2754}"
839,"Good morning. Just one more question on the FICC side. You mentioned in terms of looking at the business, and maybe some the client gaps, the market share. I guess when we look at the first half of 2017, it's weak and maybe commodities is a bigger part of that. But I think even in 2016, when we look at the global competitors, it seems like the FICC business has been a little bit more challenged. So I'm just trying to figure out how far along again in that process is the management team or is the FICC franchise in terms of reassessing whether it's the client, the product mix, to try to diversify and broaden, like, some of the growth opportunities?","{'neg': 0.028, 'neu': 0.843, 'pos': 0.129, 'compound': 0.9225}"
840,"Okay. And then just a follow-up I guess on CCAR and just capital priorities. Given I guess the combination of some of the challenges on the trading side but then also just the valuation, the stock, has anything changed in terms of how much you guys are focused on capital return versus reinvesting in the business? M&A activity? And if there's areas – I know you guys have been active on the asset management side, but anything else on that front?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.842, 'pos': 0.158, 'compound': 0.907}"
841,"So, you talked a lot about customer sets and just very, very low levels of volatility and activity. And I think a lot of that has sort of manifested in the market, so we get that. That said, you've said now twice, in last quarter's call and this one, that you could've navigated the markets better. Is that only with respect to commodities? Is that more broadly?

842,"Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then turning the page to equities, which we haven't really talked about much, but where you actually had a pretty meaningful improvement relative to both of the reference quarters. And looking in particular at the customer execution, are you starting to see some of the benefits of the investments that you've made in quant-oriented products? Did you just have a very successful period in terms of equity derivatives despite the fact that vol wasn't great, right? Actually, you said cash products. It doesn't sound like it was that. Maybe you can just give us a little bit more color for how you saw such a significant increase in execution results?","{'neg': 0.051, 'neu': 0.724, 'pos': 0.225, 'compound': 0.9718}"
843,"Super. Thanks. And just one more for me, which is sort of part question, part observation on the CCAR result. I guess, the question is would you ever consider changing your policy to tell us what you were approved for, like all your peers do? I think analysts/investors are grown-up enough to understand it's not a commitment, that it's just an approval.

844,"Hey. Good morning. My question is more on a macro level as we're looking at potential LCR and kind of SLR easing. I'm kind of sitting back trying to think how much LCR, SLR easing could potentially increase the financing available to clients, so therefore, kind of boost trading volumes and overall market activity. And I guess, I'm kind of looking back at 2Q 2014 when we got the final SLR rule, and we saw your repo book really kind of decline that quarter. How much could easing there help overall trading activities? You're kind of attracting trading activities as opposed to just helping Goldman Sachs. I mean, do you have a feel for how big an impact that had in your trading businesses back in 2Q 2014? And so, I mean, has the availability of financing to kind of active trading accounts been a meaningful deterioration, I guess, maybe problem over the last couple of years?","{'neg': 0.016, 'neu': 0.825, 'pos': 0.159, 'compound': 0.9631}"
845,"Two questions. Just one, you mentioned in the prepared remarks that some of what you think you'll be doing or focusing on as an organization is just plain old blocking and tackling.

846,"Got it. Okay. And then just separately, switching gears to Marcus. There's been some commentary. I think Lloyd and others have talked about the take-up rate that you've had. Could you give us a sense of progression from here? Are you looking for the same level of growth that you've been able to generate? And how much over the course of the next couple of years do you anticipate taking your risk capital and utilizing it in Marcus?And then last, does it help with CCAR at all?Oh, the Marcus revenue stream, the NII associated with it, does that help at all with CCAR? Is there an opportunity to improve the optionality in the capital structure by having this type of revenue stream come through?","{'neg': 0.016, 'neu': 0.86, 'pos': 0.124, 'compound': 0.9254}"
847,"Hey. I've got a follow-up on FICC. So, you spoke to the market-making and issues with central risk book, but just wanted to dig in a little, because, sequentially, VaR is down for you guys, but yet stable at many of your money center competitors, which I would think should normalize for market volatility, so could you square those two factors going on? Did something happen where the market-making difficulties you ran into were early on in the quarter, and then you guys cut back a bit on the balance sheet? That's what led to the VaR decline versus peers sequentially? How did that all shake out, or any increased color would be helpful?","{'neg': 0.074, 'neu': 0.843, 'pos': 0.083, 'compound': 0.4696}"
848,"Okay. Okay. And then another follow-up here on the commodity comments that you made earlier. So, a few years ago, Goldman disclosed the breakdown of your FICC business with commodities being roughly 8% of ICS revenues. It seems as though your commentaries suggest that, that has increased in recent years. Can you give us a sense about how large you think on average that's trended over the last couple years versus this several years ago disclosure at this point?Okay. Is it possible just to clarify a bit here? Given it's the worst commodities quarter on record, does that mean that it might've actually even been a – there could've been a negative revenue figure or was it positive or is that something you cannot disclose?","{'neg': 0.06, 'neu': 0.864, 'pos': 0.077, 'compound': -0.212}"
849,"Hey. Good morning. Maybe a question on the derivatives bigger picture. You guys have always had superior risk management that's enabled you to be kind of top market share in derivatives. But I guess the question is now how much do you think or are concerned about maybe structural headwinds on the demand side when you have greater transparency in the markets, you have pressures on fees and flows on active managers from passives, and even exchanges are trying to grab market share from OTC markets? At what point I guess do you start to rethink that business and your advantage in that business or is it something, hey, we just have to maintain our top market share and, hopefully, it comes back? Just how are you thinking about the response to any, I guess, continued pressure in that business relative to the peer group?","{'neg': 0.056, 'neu': 0.774, 'pos': 0.171, 'compound': 0.9498}"
850,"That makes sense. Just maybe one quick follow-up on that. Do you think there's a correlation in, say, a hedge fund client's willingness to take on leverage in the derivatives markets? Is it correlated you think with sort of flows, like their desire to stay more liquid and therefore don't want to take on, say, more illiquid assets like derivatives, and that's something we should be watching to see an inflection there? How do you think about what is driving their decision-making process?","{'neg': 0.014, 'neu': 0.853, 'pos': 0.133, 'compound': 0.8594}"
851,"Thanks. Hey, Marty. So I had a follow-up question on the line of discussion on derivatives. There was a report that was published a few years ago by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission which showed that derivatives actually contributed more than 50% of your FICC revenue. And given the impact that weaker derivatives had on results this quarter and recognizing, as you noted, there were a lot of different derivative product formats we need to think through, I mean, how has that mix evolved in recent years and how should we expect that to traject longer-term?","{'neg': 0.072, 'neu': 0.898, 'pos': 0.03, 'compound': -0.6249}"
852,"Got it. And just one follow-up for me on the discussion on the Treasury white paper and the SLR in particular. We and many of our clients are going through the exercise of trying to assess the cumulative benefit that could accrete to you as well as many of your peers, and you noted that the SLR and CCAR appears to be your binding constraint today. But the constraint that appears to be nearly as binding is the 4% Tier 1 leverage in CCAR. I didn't know if you had any thoughts as to whether you anticipate that, in a similar vein or fashion, that the carve out would be applied to that measure as well or how you're thinking about binding this in the event that you get some of those reforms as outlined by the Treasury push through?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.931, 'pos': 0.069, 'compound': 0.7783}"
853,"Thank you. Good morning, Marty. I don't know if I heard you correctly, and I apologize ahead of time, but when you were talking about the FICC business, obviously the customer behavior in the markets, the lack of volatility was a contributor to the weak number in FICC. But I think you also said you weren't as happy about your navigating or your company's navigating the markets. If I heard it correctly, how much of the downturn was due to the customers versus your own trading capabilities, and how does that compare to the first quarter when you compare the two?","{'neg': 0.103, 'neu': 0.837, 'pos': 0.06, 'compound': -0.815}"

856,"Hi, Martin. Thank you for taking my questions. My question is basically we talked a lot about Equities, and obviously the performance is very strong particularly after, I think, the relative underperformance in Q1. And I wanted to actually touch on the equity capital markets, on the ECM. I was surprised because the figure was actually weaker than I was expecting, and it was coming off a weak-ish Q2 2016, and I also believe that the Dealogic numbers were pointing up overall materially for the quarter. So would you mind telling me if there was something special there or you think like it was a kind of one-off that's going to be reversed in Q3?","{'neg': 0.025, 'neu': 0.863, 'pos': 0.113, 'compound': 0.8516}"
857,"Great. And if I can turn your attention into the I&L division. You've already spoken about the NII strength, and you said that the figure is more than $400 million. I'm just trying to get a feeling on the recurring part that relates to your increased lending through corporate and private banking versus the standard kind of one-off interest that's coming from your equity investments.

858,"Good morning. Thanks, Marty. So a couple of quick questions here. On the deposit front, I know you've been growing in kind of consumer, I guess we would call those consumer deposits, and I know that you haven't really been growing markets that much.

Are they supporting I&L?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.818, 'pos': 0.182, 'compound': 0.8919}"

860,"Hi. Thanks. I appreciate all the detail on the net interest income discussion. One piece of it on the repo borrowings part of it financing the equity financing side. I'm curious if you think of that as a little episodic and you kind of just go with the flow or is it more a permanent part of the strategy where you're using your strong balance sheet to help grow? The tag along to that is if it's more permanent, why do with the repo is that more expensive?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.821, 'pos': 0.179, 'compound': 0.9456}"
861,"Got it. I appreciate that. Then the tag along for net interest income guidance is as you mentioned very low deposit beta on the Consumer side, just 2 basis points up in the quarter. Is there a point in time where you expect that to accelerate over the next couple of hikes? I know we all kind of ask the same thing each quarter but it's amazingly low.","{'neg': 0.07, 'neu': 0.874, 'pos': 0.056, 'compound': -0.2349}"
862,"Just to follow-up on the NII Paul, it sounds like when you net a few positives and negatives in terms your NII outlook for next quarter, are you expecting a modest increase in the third quarter as of now? Could you put any size parameters on that?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.831, 'pos': 0.169, 'compound': 0.8205}"
863,No. That's fine. Maybe you could just remind us how much the Fed hike itself or what your estimate of how much that helps the June hike? And then also just how much did the lower 10-year hurt in the second quarter? How should we think about the 10-year impact going forward? So the short-end and the long-end impacts would be helpful.

864,"Okay. And then, just on expenses, could you help us think through the expense trajectory for the back half of the year and more importantly, your current thoughts on the target for the $53 billion in next year? And some of the – maybe the tech consolidation you did this quarter, how does that impact, either the timing or just confidence level on delivering the expense saves?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.851, 'pos': 0.149, 'compound': 0.8706}"
865,"Okay, great. Thanks. Good morning. May be getting back to the deposit question. You guys are growing 9% in the Consumer book, better than the industry despite holding low, obviously reflecting your mix. How far do you think – A, I guess, can you give your sense of what you think is driving sort of that market share? And is this something where you're willing to test the patience of your customers to lag deposit rates until growth slows more materially? How do we think about what your decision making process is in terms of rates in the Consumer book?","{'neg': 0.021, 'neu': 0.772, 'pos': 0.207, 'compound': 0.9593}"
866,"All right. Well, thanks for that. Maybe Brian to follow-up on regulation. Obviously, the Treasury report seemed pretty favorable for the industry. You're not really leverage constrained.

867,Thanks. Good morning. If I can ask questions on the card business. First of all I notice that the card losses were up first to second. They're typically down. And I was wondering if you can help us understand just where we are in the seasoning of the portfolio also noting that the risk adjusted margin continues to slip as well. So what do you think about card losses going forward and when do we see that bottoming of the card margin? Thanks.,"{'neg': 0.081, 'neu': 0.774, 'pos': 0.145, 'compound': 0.7184}"
868,"Understood. And if I can just ask one big picture one, all the points you made earlier, all the credit metrics are going the right way otherwise NPAs, inflows et cetera. Kind of coming back into this point about where card's going and then just not seeing anything else, you guys have been at 40 basis points of losses, any reason to see that changing really? And then do you still have some room for release as well given that?","{'neg': 0.032, 'neu': 0.907, 'pos': 0.06, 'compound': 0.3313}"
869,"Brian, two questions. One on the Consumer Banking efficiency ratio, you mentioned you know that there still is room for that to fall from the 52% which is obviously very efficient as it stands right now today. And you know you indicated all various opportunities to drive incremental revenues at a much improved expense ratio with all the digital that you outlined earlier. But could you speak to how the branch network could also impact those numbers? I mean your branch has been coming down about 3% the last couple of years. Is that the kind of pace that you think you're going to continue or does the digital improvements enable you to move even faster there?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.909, 'pos': 0.091, 'compound': 0.8384}"
870,"Okay, thanks for that. And then separately, you've spoken before about the op-risk SA-CCR RWA burden that you guys have. We had some questions coming on how you're thinking improvements there could help you given that it's not directly in the CCAR stress test. But you know, maybe you could give us a sense as to how you think any changes could help you given that it's not a constraining factor?","{'neg': 0.05, 'neu': 0.813, 'pos': 0.137, 'compound': 0.6808}"
871,"And then just lastly, you had a nice increase in the dividend. Could you just speak to, how you're thinking about dividend payout ratios? Do you feel like you – where you should be given the business model or is there more room and if there is more room what the drivers are to effect that change?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.867, 'pos': 0.133, 'compound': 0.7882}"
872,"In looking at your ROE, your returns on allocated capital in the Consumer and Wealth Management businesses are very strong well over 20%, Global Bank's 18%, Global Markets' about 10%. Can you share with us, how you're going to get the 8% ROE up let's say above your cost of capital let's say 10%?

877,"Hi, good morning. So, Brian, I appreciate the helpful commentary you've given on capital ratios and the continued efforts to optimize your RWAs. And just given the significant capital cushion that you're operating with today, I'm just wondering how you're thinking about the payout trajectory over the next couple of years. And maybe, just to help us frame it from an ROE perspective, because you did note that your excess capital continues to be a drag on returns, what do you believe is a reasonable spot capital target for you to manage through this cycle?","{'neg': 0.018, 'neu': 0.823, 'pos': 0.159, 'compound': 0.9257}"
878,"Got it. And then just on some of the expense initiatives, Brian, that you outlined, I'm getting quite a few questions on how we should think about it from a timing perspective.

879,"Thanks, Brian. And just one more quick one from me.

First, wanted to follow-up on the net interest income, the 100 basis point – the benefit of the $3.2 billion you get from 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve, you mentioned it's primarily sensitive to the short-end. I think last quarter you gave a sort of a 75:25 split between short- and long-end. Is that still a good rule of thumb to use?Okay. So, a little bit more skewed to the long-end than the disclosure in 1Q.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.861, 'pos': 0.139, 'compound': 0.8957}"
881,"Okay. Got it. Moving on just to discuss capital deployment strategies a little bit, you've talked about your excess capital position, obviously, your returns and the CCAR cycling and you'll keep going forward with that. But is it too early to talk about acquisitions as part of the capital strategy? And how would you think about M&A is in terms of opportunities, whether from a product strategy, geographic segmentation standpoint, how do you think about M&A in the context of your capital strategy?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.938, 'pos': 0.062, 'compound': 0.6381}"
882,"Thanks. I've got three bigger picture kind of questions. First, Brian you've turned the corner on the customer growth and business growth. I mean, that was one of my main concerns after so many years of having to deal with the overhang issues to be able to kind of reenergize and get that business segments growing again. What are the couple of things that you could say has helped go through that inflection point as quick as you've been able to do that?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.888, 'pos': 0.112, 'compound': 0.8316}"
883,"Paul, wanted to – sort of a second question – look at you know we've talked about you know the core, core, core and that the company has taken actions to try to drive that. But really we've had an historical shift in the liquidity premium coming out of the financial crisis and just having rates at zero. So hasn't a lot of this shift been related to just the environment more than really company actions? And what we're seeing has been the de-risking now that GWIM deposits are starting to move out, is that the first sign of you know the rerisking or the customer's willing to take a little bit more risk and drop that liquidity premium? So I'm kind of watching for that first sign of the customer behavior beginning to change.","{'neg': 0.085, 'neu': 0.915, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.9144}"
884,"It just seemed like there was a little bit of a change seen there. You'll see it kind of ripple into some of the other business maybe later, but the third question was, with what's going on in the mortgage business. You're retaining 90% of the loans in the past – well, I don't know the number, but I bet you were securitizing before the financial crisis approximately 90% of the loans. How do you look at that business different? That that is such a paradigm shift that you really are now a portfolio lender much more than you are a securitization. Is there any other dynamics that we should look at separately?","{'neg': 0.06, 'neu': 0.847, 'pos': 0.093, 'compound': 0.1967}"
885,"Great. Thanks. I just had question first on the lending environment overall.

886,"Okay. Great. And then just a question on Wealth and Investment Management, you did see the financial advisors increase 2 percentage points quarter-on-quarter.

887,"During the quarter, Jamie had made a comment on potential disruptions related to the unwinding of the U.S. balance sheet.

889,"So thanks for that clarity on the trading-related NII. I wanted to follow up on the loan yield side, which not much moved. You mentioned the $75mm in Mortgage.

891,"Understood, okay. And then my second question is it was nice to see the Card revenues on the fee side and the revenue capture rate move towards the way you’ve been saying.

893,Second question is on – a little bit of a ticky-tacky but on FASB. They’re working on changing some of the hedge accounting rules.

And my second question, you mentioned at the beginning of the call that Standardized will ultimately be your CET1 binding constraint, and I’m wondering, if you were allowed to float off your current op risk floor, and I think it’s still $400B, does that mean if Standardized is your constraint that being able to float off the floor and model out your op risk may not be an incremental source of capital because Standardized is binding?","{'neg': 0.052, 'neu': 0.917, 'pos': 0.031, 'compound': -0.1779}"

Your earnings are up 30% year on year, loan growth C&I 9%, CRE up 15%. And we’re not talking about small numbers anymore. I think your loan book now is about $200B in Commercial Banking. Can you maybe just talk about some of the initiatives that you’ve discussed of the Middle Market, the IB, and how sustainable that is, and whether you’re comfortable with the risk profile of the book you have there?

If I can follow up with a bigger picture question and, Jamie, you’ve been, and correct me if I’m wrong, you’ve been pretty vocal about believing that the underpinnings of our economy are healthy and strong and not buying into the whole secular stagnation argument. But at what point does political dysfunction and political paralysis really start to dent that confidence? Because you’ve also indicated that we do need structural reform to lift trend growth, whether it’s infrastructure, tax reform, whatever it is. And can you just comment on that?

Does it book on run-off, or can you move it over to a branded offer? So, just any thoughts you can provide there.And then, two, on the comments around the charge-off guidance.

So, we should expect some moderate increase versus that threshold. Is that the right way to think about it?Okay. Modest. Okay. Fair enough. Okay. So, if my math is right, that's still something around the neighborhood of, I don't know, 130 basis point points ROA, or so.

Can you just share with us how you're thinking about potentially looking at non-organic types of opportunities in terms – whether it'd be from a product's financial return, segment strategy?

One of the things that we've been hearing from a lot of folks is just given the strong improvement in your CCAR results, you have some of the benefits outlined in the Treasury white paper that was published recently. It does feel to us like the 150 basis points of cushion that you're assuming within your 11.5% target is very conservative. And I recognize that it's going be a multiyear process for you to take your 13% today and bring it back down into 11.5% over time.

922,"Understood, and then maybe just one follow-up on leverage exposure. You've spoken in the past about how leverage is not your binding constraint. You see compelling opportunities to deploy some of that excess. We saw pretty decent uptick in leverage exposure this quarter and even some last quarter as well.

923,"Got it, and just one more quick one for me. Just on liquidity, which has been certainly a popular topic ahead of the Fed balance sheet unwind. Looking at your LCR, it's at a very healthy 123%. And despite significant cushion, you've talked about resolution planning as a binding constraint on liquidity deployment. I'm just wondering whether you believe – or what you think is at least an appropriate LCR target for the firm, and how we should think about maybe some excess capacity for deployment as the Fed begins to unwind the balance sheet, maybe providing some opportunities to deploy some of that excess cash in higher yielding MBS.Okay. But if I'm understanding you correctly that your comments, John, suggest that you need to manage to around 120% liquidity in order to meet the standards for the resolution plan that you hold yourselves to and hopefully the Fed and the FDIC will approve.","{'neg': 0.008, 'neu': 0.922, 'pos': 0.07, 'compound': 0.8248}"

You guys showed your pretty good loan growth, but yet you did mention that loan yields were down a little bit, and you had some mix as far as the NIM is concerned. But I'm just wondering. Can you help us distill whether the decline in loan yields was related to the ongoing Corporate/Other runoff, and/or is there just a different mix in terms of the – it looks like it's card that's growing the most, so I'm just wondering what's happening underneath the surface, especially with a couple of rate hikes in between the last couple quarters.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.832, 'pos': 0.168, 'compound': 0.9481}"
925,"Right. Okay, understood, and then just one follow-up on the card business. It's also a piecemeal one, but simply, your net credit margin in both retail and in branded cards, as you've talked, has continued to go down, and you're talking about that inflection.

936,"And so maybe bluntly, if we get a couple more hate rate hikes, do you capture the majority of it? Even without, as you said, a rate story, do you have to hike along the way? Are the clients looking to participate in that move up?","{'neg': 0.095, 'neu': 0.905, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.6739}"
937,"Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. So, first on FICC, really, again, encouraging to see the sustained stability. Say that a few times fast.

Can you give us a sense for the different business lines now that the business has been adjusted?

939,"Good morning. So I wanted to start off with a question on wealth management pre-tax margin. It's certainly encouraging to see that you guys eclipsed the 25% target for the quarter. I'm just wondering as we look ahead to the second half, given a number of favorable trends for the business that, Jon, you had cited, whether it's strong fee-based conversions, healthy loan growth, and NIM expansion, I'm wondering, barring any exogenous market shocks, whether you'll be able to sustain margins above that 25% target for the remainder of the year?","{'neg': 0.025, 'neu': 0.739, 'pos': 0.236, 'compound': 0.9652}"
940,"Thanks. And just one follow-up on capital. You guys had outlined a couple of the potential benefits that – to your business in terms of capital relief that were outlined in the treasury white paper. One of the areas that's gotten quite a bit of focus is this notion that – or the prospect for cash and liquid assets to be excluded from the SLR denominator. And I'm wondering, given that 4% – the Tier 1 leverage constraint in CCAR of 4% appears to be your binding constraint for the moment. It's not clear whether that carve-outs going to apply that measure.

941,"Just looking at the VaR and the RWA metrics, which you talked about and floated up on an average basis I guess at an 8%, depending on which one you look at, could you give us a sense for, given that those are average daily metrics, what we look like at on a spot basis towards the end of the quarter?

942,"Great, that's helpful. And then just my follow-up question is more targeted on FICC specifically. Given the success that you've had in generating revenue even in a period like the one that we've just had, which was certainly weaker characterized by low volatility, et cetera, and all the things that you've said, would you consider raising your quarterly average expectation from that $1 billion number you've been talking about for quite a while now?","{'neg': 0.058, 'neu': 0.746, 'pos': 0.196, 'compound': 0.8957}"
943,"Great, thanks. Good morning, maybe just a follow-up on the SLR and the treasury report. If we assume that both the Tier 1 leverage ratio and the SLR are treated similarly by excepting cash and maybe short-term treasuries, how do you think that impacts the business? I guess I think a lot of people are asking the question, is this a revenue opportunity to re-expand the balance sheet, whether it be repo or other businesses, or is it really more of an excess capital story?

945,"Hey, thanks, good morning. Maybe first here, just in wealth management, you've recently outlined the digitization strategy, which was very helpful.

I guess the question is, is the revenue opportunity here just much more of an offset or do you just not think this is something that would appeal to some of your existing higher net worth clients for a portion of their account, it's just a different bucket.","{'neg': 0.026, 'neu': 0.792, 'pos': 0.182, 'compound': 0.9764}"

As things currently stand, your SLR under the severely adverse scenario, that's 3.2%, and you're slightly above the 3% minimum.

How are you getting on with that? Because obviously it's a big change.And then perhaps to link it up with the end of the Smith Barney payouts, talk about what you think this might do to your pre-tax margin. Because I think at one stage, you said it might add – once the Smith Barney payouts, the retention packages have gone out I think next year, you might be adding 1.5 percentage points to your pre-tax margin.

Especially for a security that gets no TLAC credit. If we think about where your Tier 1 position is vs. your stated target, it’s hopefully above that. I mean is there some accounting?

We have kind of a $2 billion increase in adjusted expense. And post 2017, the expense growth looks very modest.

And obviously, there is a lot of uncertainty to the content, the timing, heck, whether it even happens or not.But if we do see something that is sensible, however you want to define it, how quickly do you think that we could start to see that beating through into better sentiment and ultimately into better demand or increased demand for credit?","{'neg': 0.069, 'neu': 0.783, 'pos': 0.148, 'compound': 0.8625}"

Just kind of think about that dynamic, because that's really where you begin to see pressure on betas is typically when you see pressure on volumes. And we just haven't seen it in the core deposit base yet.So a premium for liquidity that's been kind of pushed into those core customers from corporate and retail seems to be pretty persistent, which will mean the duration and the length and the growth of deposits will be much longer than what we probably anticipated before?","{'neg': 0.04, 'neu': 0.839, 'pos': 0.121, 'compound': 0.9116}"

1129,"Hey. What I wanted to focus on is your deposit beta has been higher than the peers, which is abnormal comparedto your history. And that has really been, I think, reflective of you wanting to, especially with corporate and wealthmanagement customers, not give them any other reason in this period to look anywhere else. So you’ve beendefensive in your deposit pricing, which has not been the case in the past. You’ve been much more offensive andaggressive in being able to hold back those deposits.When you look at your asset structure, because of the duration that that would have had you to assume on yourdeposit side over time, you would have extended your assets. So what you’re kind of getting is a fundamentalshift in your deposit beta, which doesn’t reflect on your asset side. So you got almost a mismatch and I’m justwondering if that’s the way to kind of think about this, and is this how and why we’re not seeing the marginexpansion that we’re seeing in some of the other banks?And I was thinking that, that might be temporary in the sense that you used to be able to be the most aggressivelager, which helped you to be able to expand when everybody else was expanding but also maintain a highermargin because you have extended your duration on your assets prudently. So that defended your margin in adeclining rate environment but takes away a little of the punch on the way up that you used to be able to make byjust being half of what everybody else did in deposit increases.","{'neg': 0.008, 'neu': 0.959, 'pos': 0.033, 'compound': 0.5273}"

1182,"And then as we think about the deposit growth driving the balance sheet growth, you've got this flatter yield curve and some people – my personal view is if you get additional increase in the short end, you might have further flattening.  I'm just wondering the thought process to keep building the securities book and the mortgage book, you're seeing some banks shrinking the securities book and building cash instead, and obviously, there's the cost of doing that.

1184,Morning. The first question was on the first mortgage production that you mentioned. You said that you're putting most of that on the balance sheet.

If you get to the $53 billion, whenever that is, 2018 or whenever you get there, around 2018, you drive down your efficiency ratio even further to, say, 57%, 58%, so you're pretty close to sort of your competitors despite the fact that your business mix is one that has more wealth management and which has a higher efficiency ratio.                               So how should we think about your ability, the opportunity set, to continue to drive positive operating leverage over a multiyear period and get your efficiency ratio down even further to the mid- to low-50% range?

And separately, we did see your GSIB surcharge also increased last quarter or your systemic risk score, and I'm wondering how you're thinking on managing to that as well.","{'neg': 0.015, 'neu': 0.822, 'pos': 0.163, 'compound': 0.9613}"
1234,"Yeah, just around the GSIB score. I think. In the past year, you had been at 2.5%, and it increased to 3% last quarter. And how you're thinking about managing that score as you think about some of the growth initiatives?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.843, 'pos': 0.157, 'compound': 0.7096}"
1235,"Good. So, maybe first one here. The securities-based loan arrangement with Fidelity that was announced last quarter was pretty interesting. And I'm curious, is that starting to ramp? And it also sounded like there could be more arrangements in the future with additional wealth management firms that don't have those capabilities. So, really, just trying to get a sense of the broader securities-based loan strategy, the firm kind of with outside firms, and how big that is within kind of the Private Wealth piece of the balance sheet opportunity?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.775, 'pos': 0.225, 'compound': 0.9689}"
1236,"Okay. That's helpful. Can I just follow up here? It sounded like some of the hiring that firm's doing ahead of revenue could influence the comp ratio a bit, but it sounded like that's going be modest. Can you maybe just more broadly speak to what you're seeing in the competitive environment in the comp dynamics right now? It seems like some of the European firms are more aggressively recruiting again in some of the areas that Goldman's also looking to expand. So, maybe that's temporary, but I'm just curious kind of how that feeds through as you think about the outlook for the comp ratio.","{'neg': 0.028, 'neu': 0.784, 'pos': 0.188, 'compound': 0.9448}"
1237,"Question, a lot has been talked about amongst you folks as well as your peers about the lack of volatility in the marketplace, particularly in FICC.

1238,"Great. And then second question, can you give us some color on – you'd talked about the total dollar amount of the capital return on the call today.

One was when you think of the investing and lending, especially on the equities side, where you said you all, given the market conditions – or you said kind of harvesting aggressively, is part of that related to – because if you look at the increase here, about $1.8 billion increase in what you had in the equities security gains, there's about a $1.3 billion decline in fixed income. So, you kind of have an offsetting effect with those two things, which is letting your overall revenue still grow this year.So, I just didn't know if you all were doing that just because of market conditions. Are you trying to balance the mix? And so what, should we expect this when we have some volatility in other sides of the business?","{'neg': 0.016, 'neu': 0.914, 'pos': 0.07, 'compound': 0.755}"
1240,"Then, my second question is if you look at the seasonal progression of that comp ratio, given that you do have this investment lending gains, your revenues are still kind of at the same level you had last year. So, should we still see the drop-off in comp ratio kind of at the end of the year as you true-up your bonuses and get all that squared away?Yes, usually, seasonally, we drop down around 30% in the fourth quarter. So, just know if that was still a reasonable assumption, or is there anything different about this year that would cause that to vary from several prior years where we've seen that trend?Perfect. So, year-over-year, operating leverage would be something to make sure we kind of still assume, so that would make sense.

1241,"Hi. Hi, Marty. Yeah, a quick question on capital return with that disclosure that you gave. So, I mean, the share repurchase authorization's up 50% year-on-year. When you look at kind of your DFAST, CCAR results, I mean, your capital level is up a little bit – at the starting point was up a little bit year on year.The losses that you saw within DFAST were up modestly as well, somewhat larger against within this year's CCAR to kind of return more capital. Was there some kind of change in how the Fed looked at RWA inflation, or something else? I mean, because I think historically, you said – or this previous CFO had said that there's kind of a check mark to your minimum ratios. Is that still the case?And there is no other real changes from the Fed side? And...I mean, even though the capital dollar amounts were only up less than $2 billion year-on-year starting points, you were able to increase by more than that, and then just the ratios were higher simply?","{'neg': 0.028, 'neu': 0.915, 'pos': 0.057, 'compound': 0.6278}"

One, I think that investors would like it if we figured out some solution for LIBOR. But barring that, is that something that you look at? And number one, would your regulators let you do basically an off market deal and not exercise those clauses, if it should come to that? Number one.

Wells Fargo has targeted $4 billion of expense savingsto be achieved by year-end 2019 with $2 billion falling to the bottom line. Management recently noted it couldachieve 50% of this by year-end 2018. How are you translating this into your 2019 expense outlook for WellsFargo? One, 2019 expenses will be meaningfully lower, that means 3% to 5% than the core 2017 level exlitigation,estimates also need to consider the $1 billion in other expenses, like core deposit, intangible and FDICspecial assessment that could roll off that are not included in the $4 billion target; two, 2019 expenses will bemodestly 1% to 3% lower than the core 2017 level; three, 2019 expenses roughly flat with 2017 core level as business as usual expense growth will mitigate cost saves; or four, I have low confidence in my 2019 expenseoutlook and need to see more progress from Wells or receive more color. Five seconds left. So this is interesting. You all have high confidence in your expense outlook for 2019. None of you pick that. 34% of you, most popularanswer are looking for 1% to 3% lower costs into 2019 versus 2017. 31% of you say essentially flat and only 19%of you say meaningfully lower.

And it would be useful within that if you could touch on what you're seeing across the JPMorgan platform, both in terms of consumer activity and corporate activity.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.866, 'pos': 0.134, 'compound': 0.9252}"

1356,"Okay. So let's talk about JPMorgan operating leverage specifically. Last two years, your core efficiency ratios improved by 250 basis points and you've done something pretty unusual, which is that you've grown revenues at the same time that you've maintained really very solid expense discipline. What's your ability to continue to do that? I know there's been some one-off factors that have brought expenses down, but as you think about the next few years, what is your ability to continue to drive that decoupling between revenue growth and expense reductions?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.824, 'pos': 0.176, 'compound': 0.9231}"
1357,"Okay. So, are there any specific areas that you think is still a meaningful opportunity from a market share standpoint to JPMorgan? I mean, it does feel as if you've closed a lot of the gaps that existed seven or eight years ago. When you look across your portfolio or even geographies, is there something you look at and say, look, if we could close that gap, it would actually make a real difference?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.872, 'pos': 0.128, 'compound': 0.8205}"
1358,"Okay. So, just spend a second on fixed income, because that was one of the areas as you said that you took meaningful market share in.

1359,"Okay. So, let's talk about technology. It's obviously a very important area. You're spending $9 billion a year, I think roughly, on technology; $3 billion of that, I think, is discretionary. How do you benchmark where you've got to and how do you think about the return on the investment on the discretionary piece?

1361,"Yeah. Okay. So, let's talk about your financial targets. You're getting very close to your 15% return on tangible common equity target. I know you're going to give an update on the Investor Day. I doubt you're going to update that there.

1362,"Okay, great. So, perhaps we can talk a little bit about rate sensitivity. So, I guess two areas. The first is on deposit betas. They've obviously started to pick up more recently, but it does seem very concentrated in both corporate and high net worth. Retail deposit pricings remain very, very stable. What do you think it takes for retail deposit pricing to start to move and what are your expectations around deposit betas as we get the next two, three, four rate hikes?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.886, 'pos': 0.114, 'compound': 0.8405}"
1363,"I know this is difficult to answer, but conceptually, 100 basis points of rate hikes have led to about 12% net interest income growth, about, in this quarter, 20 basis points of net interest margin expansion.

1364,"Okay. So let's talk about CCAR a little bit. So, you exceeded 100% payout ratio for the first time post-crisis. I know in your shareholder letter you said that buybacks make sense up to 2 times tangible book. I think your stock is now trading at 2 times tangible book. I mean, look, how are you conceptually thinking about returning capital to shareholders? And I guess, look at the specific question, if the Fed does remove the soft capital on dividend payouts, would you reconfigure the way in which you're distributing capital to shareholders?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.974, 'pos': 0.026, 'compound': 0.3094}"
1365,"Okay. And then, just broadly, I mean, how do you think about acquisitions in terms of use of capital?

1366,"Okay. So, let's talk a little bit about the capital market businesses. So, volatility has obviously been quite low this quarter, very difficult comps relative to last year post the election.

1368,"Okay. So, let me ask one other question before I see if there's anything in the audience. So, credit loss has obviously been very benign. Is there anything that you're watching more closely in your loan portfolio?

It does feel like a disconnect that can persist indefinitely.","{'neg': 0.03, 'neu': 0.748, 'pos': 0.222, 'compound': 0.9403}"

1370,"So even as you've been very disciplined on costs, you've been investing across the franchise.

1372," I mean, regulatory reform was obviously a really important theme last year; it's still an important theme today. The difference is most of the roles have not been filled.

1373,"So, Brian, I thought a good place to start – and it's kind of how we started all of the discussions so far this year is just how you're thinking about the environment as we head into 2018? There's obviously a lot of moving pieces around corporate tax reform and around deregulation. What are you expecting in terms of changes in economic growth rates? What's your base case for interest rates? And what type of impact do you think that corporate tax reform would have if it was successfully enacted on the outlook for next year?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.872, 'pos': 0.128, 'compound': 0.9173}"

1375,Okay. So perhaps we can talk a little bit about loan growth? So I think what's a little more surprising features of what's happened this year has been the slowdown both in corporate loan growth but also in some of the consumer categories this year. Can you talk a little bit about some of the dynamics in the lending markets broadly and specific to what you're seeing in your portfolios?,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.864, 'pos': 0.136, 'compound': 0.7662}"
1376,"Yeah. So, can you talk a little bit about that? Because you have outperformed on the C&I side, in particular. I think you've outperformed by 200 basis points relative to your peers. What do you attribute that to? Is it just, to your point, just a more consistency of the growth rate over time or are there some strategic components to it, and to what extent do you think you can continue to outgrow the industry if growth remained slow?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.903, 'pos': 0.097, 'compound': 0.787}"
1377,"So – but based on your discussions on the corporate side, do you think corporate tax reform is going to unleash a wave of new demand? Do you think people have been putting off CapEx spending in anticipation of this?","{'neg': 0.053, 'neu': 0.907, 'pos': 0.04, 'compound': -0.1306}"
1378,"Okay. So let's talk a little about operating leverage. So I think, on annum, your core revenue over the last few years is up $5 billion, expenses are down $2.5 billion and that's translated to this very dramatic improvement in your efficiency ratios. It's also quite unusual though to see that dynamic of that type of revenue growth with that type of expense reduction. How repeatable do you think that is? And as you think about the next few years, what do you think the efficiency ratio could get to and how are you thinking about the $53 billion target?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.854, 'pos': 0.146, 'compound': 0.9292}"
1379,"Okay. So how are you thinking about the long-term targets? Because, I mean, you're pretty close to what you publicly stated which is a 12% ROTC and a 60% efficiency ratio.

1380,"Okay. Okay. So let's talk about some of your strategic priorities. So you've been very consistent in the past few years saying that you wanted to invest in the wealth management business. You wanted to hire sales specialists in the consumer bank and you wanted to gain market share in the investment bank.I mean, it does feel as if you've done a lot of those. How do your thought processes evolved over where you want to invest going forward? Should we think that those initiatives are now largely complete or are they still a work in progress and how are you thinking about the return on those investments?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.853, 'pos': 0.147, 'compound': 0.9332}"
1381,"Right. Okay. So let's talk about asset sensitivities. So, net interest income is up about 8% this year.

1382,"Right. So, what do you think it takes for core retail deposits to start to re-price with having the market being stable across the industry?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.916, 'pos': 0.084, 'compound': 0.296}"
1383,"Okay. So let's talk about the current operating environment. I mean, volatility obviously has remained quite low this quarter, difficult comps from last year obviously plus the election.

1384,"Okay. So let's talk about capital returns. I know you came out with an announcement today, an incremental $5 billion of buyback, which I assume was an off-cycle ask?Can you talk a little bit about what drove that decision? And then just more broadly, I mean, your payout ratio is priced at around 60%. I think this takes your payout ratio from right closer to 100%, if not higher?How are you thinking about capital returns and how are you thinking about the mix between dividend and buyback, especially given the re-rating that your share price is seeing?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.947, 'pos': 0.053, 'compound': 0.6199}"
1385,"So, there's obviously a lot of discussion around how the CCAR test could change. One of the things is that 30% soft dividend cap could be removed. If that were removed, would it change your thought process in terms of where the payout ratio will go and I guess the reason I ask is, prior to the crisis, I think you had a payout ratio of in the mid-40s, if not higher? [indiscernible]","{'neg': 0.058, 'neu': 0.942, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.6249}"
1386,"Okay. So, on credit, you've previously said you expect provisions are expected to match charge-offs and you expect it to remain that way for the foreseeable future. Would you still make the same comment today?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.874, 'pos': 0.126, 'compound': 0.5829}"
1387,"So can you spend a little bit of time talking about the card business in particular and I guess, I think we're seeing a lot of your competitors use card as a customer acquisition tool?

1388,"So, on wealth management, just a couple of things. I mean, first, we've seen a number of banks exit the broker protocol. I think you've said that you're not going to do that but can you talk a little bit about how you think some of the competitive environment could change as a result of some of these – some of your peers leaving the broker protocol?And then your margins within wealth management are actually best-in-breed. How do you protect that given some of the headwinds the industry is facing in terms of the shift towards lower margin products?","{'neg': 0.027, 'neu': 0.837, 'pos': 0.135, 'compound': 0.8784}"
1389,"Okay. So, last question for me before we open it up to the audience. What's the benefit or impact or corporate tax reform on Bank of America? So, I guess two things. First, what happens to your tax rate if the Senate proposal effectively stands as it is?And secondly, like how much of the benefit do you think it's competed away over time, i.e., split with your customers in the form of you accepting a lower ROA?","{'neg': 0.025, 'neu': 0.785, 'pos': 0.19, 'compound': 0.9223}"
1390,"Brian, you talked earlier about your initial three-year plan to get cost out of the company and you're on target to be in the around $53 billion. If you think about the next leg for the story, the next three-year plan, we have heard a lot of banks talking about things like use of AI, robotics, potential for some regulatory relief on the expense side. You guys have a ton of scale in the business. As you think about the next three years beyond 2018, do you think the story shifts more towards operating leverage and that there is more investments that need to be made in the business or do you think there's enough opportunities that you can continue to hold the line on cost while growing revenue?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.926, 'pos': 0.074, 'compound': 0.836}"
1391,"Hi, Brian. I guess the question that I want to talk about was nobody is talking about credit and for good reason. I mean, it looks pretty good. But if you do look in like the bond market or the high-yield market where the amount of bonds that are being done [ph] of late (37:00) where the amount of bonds being issued at triple fee or credit spreads being at very, very low levels, particularly in Europe. I mean there all the signs that the next recession is probably going to go look a lot like the early 1990s where it's corporate-led. How are – and in the past, the banks did okay on the consumer side, but there was a lot of fallen angels, syndicated credits that ended up creating some pain across some banking systems back in that recession. How would you feel your position on that front, from a credit standpoint, kind of knowing that there's maybe some excessive risk-taking going on the corporate side?","{'neg': 0.097, 'neu': 0.744, 'pos': 0.159, 'compound': 0.7931}"
1392,"And look, I think the specific thing I just wanted to go through is, can you remind us of the macro assumptions that you built into the 2020 targets.

1393,Okay. And it obviously feels there's some potential upside at least to the scenario – at least on rates and U.S.economic growth if we get tax reform. Would that be a fair comment?,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.805, 'pos': 0.195, 'compound': 0.7003}"
1394,"Okay. So, with that as context, can you talk a little bit about what gives you confidence in the revenue component of the target. I know it was a big discussion point during the conference. I know there's various moving pieces, but in totality, what gives you the confidence as you look out to 2020 that you can get to those numbers?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.872, 'pos': 0.128, 'compound': 0.7935}"
1395,"Okay. And just briefly on the expense side. I mean things can obviously change in terms of the top line. Howmuch of a margin did you build in into the incremental expense flexibility, if the revenue environment doesdeteriorate for any reason?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.855, 'pos': 0.145, 'compound': 0.6249}"
1396,"Okay. Got it. Okay. So before we talk about some of the businesses, let's talk about the current environment. We obviously heard from a number of your peers yesterday about the capital market environment. Volatility isobviously very low. There seems to be a lack of client engagement in certain businesses. That said, yourbusiness is obviously different on the capital market side, are you seeing comparable trends?","{'neg': 0.065, 'neu': 0.793, 'pos': 0.142, 'compound': 0.5434}"

1399,"Okay. So let's talk a little bit about some of the businesses. Let's start with consumer. You've had a lot of success in acquiring portfolios in the card business in particular. Can you talk a little bit about what you think your competitive advantage is in terms of those acquisitions and how does that set you up for future portfolio bids?

1400,"Okay. So, let's talk about Costco a little bit. I mean, how has the performance of that been tracking more recently? I know the portfolio has been seasoning.

1402,"So, the timing in terms of the promotional balances rolling off, can you talk a little bit about that?

1404,"Okay. So let's talk a little bit about loss rates in Retail Services in the U.S. So you increased loss guidance from 500 basis points, to 510 basis points to 525 basis points.

Can you update us on that? And I guess outside of the U.S., obviously you're investing in Mexico.

1408,"Okay. All right. So, let's talk a little bit about the institutional business. So again, you spent a lot of time at Investor Day talking about how you differentiate yourself in that business. A couple of points, the competitive environment does seem to have intensified a little bit. We've seen a number of firms growing their balance sheet in that area. Are you seeing that translate into bit of spreads starting to contract? Are you finding it harder to take market share in that business?

1409,"So let's talk about two of the very important themes to investors, corporate tax reform and capital returns. Andperhaps we can start off with corporate tax reform. You touched on how you think it could impact economicgrowth. Can you spend a few minutes talking about the impact on Citigroup? And I guess two things. The first is, I think at the Investor Day you set out the impact of a 25% corporate tax rate. How does that change, if it's 20%, is it just linear or is there other puts and takes around it?

1411,"Right. Okay. So let's just talk briefly about CCAR. So it doesn't sound as if this would have any impact in terms of how you're thinking about CCAR from what you've just said, but I guess Governor Quarles has talked about improving the transparency of that process. Are there one or two changes that he could make to the test that would get you to go back and rethink either the amount of capital or the form in which you're returning the capital, i.e., buyback versus dividend?By that, you mean you would lower the 11.5% number?","{'neg': 0.028, 'neu': 0.903, 'pos': 0.069, 'compound': 0.4871}"

1413,"John, I'd just like clarification on one of your businesses please. Retail services, how much of that business is tantamount to your private label type businesses?All private label. So in your assumption of the loss guidance from going up to 500 (sic) [510] (36:00) basis points to 525 basis points, is there an RSA offset that you also modeled, assuming the RSA...Okay. So, the RSA may change though given the profitability that book is changing with higher credit costs.And you spoke of this businesses, the 250-basis-point type of ROA business in the past, is that through the cycle or is that just currently?","{'neg': 0.021, 'neu': 0.89, 'pos': 0.09, 'compound': 0.7622}"
