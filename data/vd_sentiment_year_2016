1,And then you referenced energy prices staying this low would lead to a significant reserve build you expect in your energy book. Can you maybe give a little bit more color around that? How would you define significant? And how long would oil need to stay down here in order to see some of that reserve action?,"{'neg': 0.039, 'neu': 0.824, 'pos': 0.137, 'compound': 0.6079}"
2,"I wanted to follow up on the oil and gas question. It just seems as though $124mm in additional provisions for oil and gas could be low, at least based on the one year forward prices for oil, which are still in the $30s. And so my question is for Jamie. As you look back, how does the oil and gas situation today compare to prior periods of stress? We have 2002, we had the TMT [Technology, Media, Telecom] meltdown. And when you were at Bank One you reduced the lines of credit, you got ahead of that early. In 2007, you weren’t exactly at the start but then you adjusted and you said hey, this is a big issue. And now we have oil and gas, which could be another industry-specific stress, and you’re only taking additional provisions of $124mm. Is that going to be enough? And one year from now, are you going to look back and say, whoops, we didn’t get ahead of this enough?And how do you use CDS to help protect yourself on that portfolio?","{'neg': 0.038, 'neu': 0.911, 'pos': 0.051, 'compound': 0.5514}"
3,"And then the last follow-up -- do you intend to keep lending to the oil and gas companies as they run into problems? On the one hand, you have the risk of throwing good money after bad. On the other hand, if you stop lending as much and you have the high-yield market retreating and you have private equity firms retreating, maybe it becomes a liquidity crisis for some of the oil companies. So which is it? Do you lend more or less to the oil and gas sector?","{'neg': 0.145, 'neu': 0.766, 'pos': 0.089, 'compound': -0.7041}"

5,"I was wondering if you could talk to us a little bit about the benefits from rates as they come through. Obviously, your commentary that NII will be even flattish in Q1 adjusted for day count and even with some securities gains in the numbers this quarter presumes a nice helper from that first move. You guys were really conservative on your deposit beta thoughts when you had talked about them previously. I know probably you haven’t seen much change yet. But how are you expecting the deposit payer to act? And has there been any change to your modeling expectations about what might come through as we get through the first couple of hikes?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.921, 'pos': 0.079, 'compound': 0.7236}"
6,"And my second question, if I can ask an ex-energy credit question, a lot of concerns that we’re going to get into some type of broader deterioration, which your numbers showed no signs of heading towards.

7,"I think you talked about some of this, Marianne, in terms of the Method 2 G-SIB surcharge, now estimated at 3.5%. I’m just curious. I think if the numbers are right, you took down notionals, and that there’s about $3.4 trillion, $21B in Level 3 assets, $50B in non-op deposits. You said that you don’t want to be an outlier, so you’re whittling that down. I’m curious of the driving force behind it, what kind of revenue give-up there is in such a move like this because we like it and thoughts on the go-forward.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.87, 'pos': 0.13, 'compound': 0.8625}"

9,"The disclosure on the oil and gas is really helpful, and I was wondering if you could just walk through something similar on metals and mining. So you gave us the – I think you said $68mm of full-year reserve build, and you gave us the not significant if things stay where they are. Can you give us the balance?

11,"I know that the Basel Committee put out their fundamental review of the trading book proposal this morning, so clearly no one has had time to really go through it in detail. However, I’m sure you have already gone through the prior proposals and done the QIS [Quantitative Impact Study] for the last couple years. The proposal is better than what had been – the ruling is better than what the proposal most recently had been. I just wanted to get a sense from you as to how you can manage to this 2019 implementation timeframe. Are there things set in motion already, or is this something that you would start from here? And if you could just give us some broad strokes on how you think about overall impact, that would be helpful.Right; I totally understand that.

12,"So I had a couple questions on capital. The first relates to the RWA progress, which did surprise positively in the year by about $50B ahead of expectations. And I was just hoping you could give a better sense, Marianne, just given some of your prepared remarks, as to how much of that incremental $50B reduction was a function of more proactive mitigation efforts maybe even tied to the G-SIB mitigation efforts that you guys had talked about, which should presumably remain in the run rate vs. balance sheet shrinkage that may be due to the risk loss environment that we’re experiencing today.","{'neg': 0.039, 'neu': 0.792, 'pos': 0.169, 'compound': 0.9273}"
13,"And then maybe just switching gears to the G-SIB surcharge, clearly the progress surprised positively by getting down to 3.5%. I was just wondering how you guys are thinking about establishing minimum capital targets. I recognize you’ll likely lay that out at Investor Day.

14,"Marianne, if I can just clarify your NII comment from the very beginning of the call, do I understand correctly that the $2B of incremental NII that you’ve cited is just a function of the repricing dynamics as they move through your balance sheet, or is there also I guess a contribution from loan growth?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.911, 'pos': 0.089, 'compound': 0.5719}"

16,"I just wanted to add a follow-up question on fixed income trading. I think Dan Pinto has talked about benefits from higher rates. And so I guess number one, I wanted to see if you had any thoughts on that. Have you seen any initial benefits to spreads in the FICC trading market with the first rate hike? And in contrast, you had a couple of competitors announce or at least reported that they’re cutting headcount. That seems to be a little bit in contrast to the expectation that fixed income could pick up with higher rates. So I think, if you could, talk through your thoughts on fixed income. I do notice that you did mention Q1 is off and performing well, so maybe that’s part of it too. But if you can help on that, that would be great.So you still feel pretty comfortable with your outlook that things could improve in market share gain potential as competitors pull back?","{'neg': 0.007, 'neu': 0.818, 'pos': 0.175, 'compound': 0.9819}"

19,"Jamie, to follow up on your comments about maybe some better pricing in prime brokerage and repo because of the capital requirements requiring you guys to raise prices, can you expand upon that?

Have you guys given any thought that when this goes into place when you may take that true-up, assuming that you have to implement it by 2019 or something like that?

That seems a little bit bigger than your peers. Generally, we’ve talked about your exposures to larger multinationals that we wouldn’t expect to see this kind of stress. So just if you could just walk us through what you’re seeing in your portfolio, where the stress is, maybe more specifics, that would be helpful?Can you help us with a sense of what you view as the worst case if we stay at $30 a barrel for 18 months to two years with how much more this might be beyond that?","{'neg': 0.074, 'neu': 0.871, 'pos': 0.054, 'compound': -0.5921}"

And obviously, there was a lot of products in CDO-land and things like that that led to the disruption that we saw. This is not the same. There are not products like that. However, I’m curious to see how you think about the potential hidden leverage or maybe the follow-on impacts in other sectors of the lower oil prices.

John, you mentioned you’re not seeing a knock-on effect from what’s taking place, I guess, in China and commodities, at least not enough to change the reserve guidance more than you’ve already done.

I know you were asked this already, but I’m going back for a second try.I can just test your conviction, you gave guidance of $600mm in loan loss provisions for ICG for H1.

Fair enough, that makes sense. But that dovetails nicely actually into my follow-up. In terms of the wholesale non-accrual balances, those were up about $1.2 billion quarter-over-quarter.

You've obviously done a fantastic job on the cost base, but one of the issues that strikes me is clearly with the reduced revenues, particularly in the capital markets business, your comp down about $400 million compared to the first quarter or the quarter of last year. And obviously, what we've experienced generally is you holding the ratio reasonably steady for the second to third quarter and then truing up with a lower ratio in the fourth quarter. If I'm looking at the estimates we have for revenues on a well-known provider of data, we've got pretty flat revenues being forecast by people like me whether we're right or wrong. Should we be thinking about how you're going to build a bonus pool against this background and whether we should be looking at thinking or thinking that you're going to have to retain the comp ratio at a pretty similar level through the year if indeed we don't see any uptick in revenues and they remain reasonably flat?Yeah. But I'm by no means arguing about the quality of the ratio. I'm just intrigued because clearly what we're seeing on most leaders and indeed in Europe is the difficulty of building a pool when you've been so used to having a very strong first quarter, obviously, makes it quite difficult.","{'neg': 0.09, 'neu': 0.779, 'pos': 0.131, 'compound': 0.8979}"

But one of the questions I perhaps just wanted to ask is an area you've been pushing hard on is equity, cash equities in particular. My sense is that actually a lot of the players including the Europeans who were doing massive restructurings are putting more capital into equities on the back of the fact that it's a lower capital business. And therefore they think they can get higher returns and just maybe that's why Nomura pulled out of European equities yesterday.

If you could just clarify why that’s the case? And the tougher one is the strategic question. Can you accelerate restructuring more than what you’ve already done?

Why not sell the Mexican bank? Monetize that gain, use the DTAs to avoid paying taxes, avoid integrating it for Project Rainbow, and use the proceeds to buy back stock? What else can you do?

When do you start thinking about entering new business lines which are radically different from the ones that you’re in now under the understanding that you can’t get anything more from what you’re doing other than waiting for the tide to come in?

I guess just jumping right into the topic that most people seem concerned about right now in the markets business, there has been a lot of change in recent years, a lot of structural change, a lot of cyclical change.

But generally   on – if you could comment on the ability to produce sort of $1 billion-plus  quarterly revenue  in FICC despite, as you pointed out, the sale of the oil merchanting and the 25% head count reduction at the end of last year. Is there any sort of warning on sustainability here that you want to issue? And if not, maybe just give us a sense for how it is that you could've  done a head count reduction that was as significant as it was and sti ll see revenue  in that kind of range.So should we conclude that...Sorry, go ahead.","{'neg': 0.028, 'neu': 0.878, 'pos': 0.094, 'compound': 0.6378}"
894,"Good morning,  James and Jon.One more on FICC here.  You've  hit on the increased volatility towards the end of the quart er leading into Brexit and then coming out of it. Do you think that that opportunity  allowed you to over-earn  somewhat in FICC this quarter,  or at least present a more unusual and robust revenue  opportunity,  which is why you were able to punch above  that 1 point – with that $1 billion per quarter run rate? And as we think about that run rate seasonally, when we look into the back half, should we think about that being lower or is that going to be less seasonal because of the changes you've  made to the business?That's  really terrific.

As we think about this business a bit longer term as well, and you think about some of the changes  that are coming from a regulatory  perspective,  how much do you anticipate your product shelf for commission accounts may be impacted? Could you give us a sense about  whether that's going to shrink and maybe frame up how that might shrink and how that might have  an impact on revenues?

I wonder if you could help on any soft comments about overall  profitability.No number, okay. In the past, you've  had a lot of seasonality in your FICC numbers.  Part of that was that the commodities business and you've  since sold oil merchanting.  I'm just curious, not for next quarter but just as a general comment, the pacing of that $4 billion a year target, goal or whatever  you want to call it.

So the trend of the RWA going down is what we should focus on anyway. And then maybe last quickie is two quick number ones. In the past, I think the difference  between your ROE and your ROTC  is in the range of 130 basis points, 140 basis points. Nothing should change that, right? We should be about that same spread now?

When you think about where that ratio is than where your SLR is, and if you are able to release capital, from a business mix standpoint, do you feel like you guys are where you need to be? And the gist of it is, if you  are able to release the capital, obviously  your CET, you don't  want to come down, but your SLR will be somewhat impacted.

On the flip side, it seems like for the industry we will see a continued trend and maybe an accelerated trend from  commission-based accounts into fee-based  accounts. So just wanted to kind of balance what type of growth we could potentially see on that side, which is maybe more annuity -like versus  the more volatile  transaction side of the business. And then for the advisors,  do you expect any consolidation in the industry, and probably  away from your type of platform but to other platforms.

So when I think about high-density  RWA, I think typically that would be more in FICC.  So just maybe help us understand where the RWA decline is coming outside of FICC. And is there more of that to go?Is that sustainable outside of FICC, the stress VAR and those kind of drivers,  or is there more to go I gues s outside of FICC?

And given the reduction that we've  seen over  the last couple of quarters  in many of your more risk-intensive assets, where do you believe the surcharge is today and how do you think about managing to that going forward,  given  some of the opportunities  not just to mitigate but potentially to even  grow in some of the trading areas as competitors   retrench?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.932, 'pos': 0.068, 'compound': 0.611}"

Given that leverage  was your binding constraint in the latest exam and that the Fed is incorporating,  as you noted, the tougher SLR requirement,  it still looks like to us that even if we include the G-SIB surcharge in full pre-mitigation, the SLR or leverage  could still be your binding constraint. And I just wanted to get a better sense as to whether the mitigation plans that you outlined are still on track. I believe  it was at the early part of the year in the strategic review  of the SLR within FICC, and are there other opportunities  that you see to drive that lower given  that that could actually prove  to be the determinant  of how much capital you need to hold?","{'neg': 0.015, 'neu': 0.897, 'pos': 0.088, 'compound': 0.8225}"
919,"Thanks, Jon. And one follow-up  from me on the Wealth Management  side. James, at the Morgan Stanley  financials conference,  you made a comment regarding  loan penetration levels  amongst some of your retail clients. I think the numbers were 2% for mortgage and 16% for SPLs. And the 16% number actually struck me as a bit  high and yet we continue to see really strong growth within that channel. As we think about modeling out the long- term growth opportunity  here, what should we think or what do you believe  are reasonable penetration  levels  that you can achieve  across both of these channels to drive  further growth?","{'neg': 0.017, 'neu': 0.794, 'pos': 0.189, 'compound': 0.9608}"

But if you could just comment on the targeted size and mandate? I mean, is it global or North American? Is it pure corporate equity or is it broader? And then I guess as a follow-on to that, if it’s $5B to $8B, the Blackstones and Apollos of the world are raising, like, $18 billion-plus. So what’s the strategy to put the money to work? Is it to go more middle-market, to do fewer deals or to bring in more co-investors? Those kinds of decisions?Okay. And should we assume that you will commit 3% to it, and is it the standard kind of asset management, one in 20 and I assume that these will show up on the asset management side.

I know – I think you commented that the quarter wasn’t a particularly strong one even though the y-over-y growth was good and that it seemed like you commented that you’re gaining share in FICC, at least among some market participants. But if we look at YTD trends in revenue, it does look like some of the U.S. money center banks are growing double-digit-plus over 2015 YTD, whereas Goldman’s revenue is down. Can you help us understand maybe why that’s diverging? Is it a business mix issue? Is there something else going on? Are you guys shifting away from certain clients or what have you?

Recognize that many of the recommendations are in fact just that that have come from the regulators. But just thinking about the strategy for this business longer term, looking at the activities more broadly, it’s been a very good profit source historically but it also consumes significant amounts of capital. And under a CCAR lens, some of the specs related, it could even be ROE dilutive overall. And I was wondering, given the current backdrop and some of the hiding regulatory scrutiny, whether you’ve considered strategic alternatives for the business such as an IPO or a spin that could generate value while maybe allowing for some degree of regulatory unshackling.","{'neg': 0.021, 'neu': 0.874, 'pos': 0.104, 'compound': 0.9013}"

I think it’s down about 15% since the end of 2014, but the advanced risk-weighted assets have actually crept higher. I know some of that’s going to be a function of increases in op risk but I was hoping you could speak to any mitigation potential that you can achieve on the advanced risk-weighted assets moving forward, particularly if the Collins floor does end up applying to some of the new proposed capital changes that Tarullo spoke to in his recent remarks.","{'neg': 0.023, 'neu': 0.853, 'pos': 0.124, 'compound': 0.8608}"

1187,"Okay. And just circling back to another question previously asked. In terms – if I back out the charge that you took in occupancy this quarter, it looks like – and as well as litigation, it looks like you’re running in the last couple of quarters at around 24%, 25% non-comp to revenue ratio. I understand revenue can be a bit volatile, but it’s been trending prior to that at 30%-plus. Is 25% a new run rate, or is it really going to depend – should we really think more about the dollar value rather than the ratio?","{'neg': 0.015, 'neu': 0.885, 'pos': 0.1, 'compound': 0.7351}"
1188,"Just to step back for a moment, can we just talk about how we should sort of contemplate revenue growth across the mix of businesses more broadly? Because I look at what’s happened this quarter and sort of what’s occurred over the course of the year, and in the underwriting businesses and in the advisory business, obviously you know the statistics much better than I, but advisory may be moving to a new lower plateau than what we’ve seen recently.

So when we look at some those initiatives like Marcus or Symphony, Marquee or consolidating the electronic trading book across businesses, and maybe I missed something there, but where do you see the most immediate opportunities to actually move the needle? And I guess that’s part one. And part two is, as you think about future investments into technology, do you think more of the incremental spend from here is going to be more offensive positioning, revenue-producing rather than defensive?","{'neg': 0.054, 'neu': 0.854, 'pos': 0.092, 'compound': 0.2963}"

When you talk about the new consumer business and lending, really doesn’t fit into any of those four.

I think you’d be at the high end of your ROE target range now if you had a similar capital ratio to the peers and you’re above 10% on a tangible.

And to what degree are the better results in FICC the result of taking share, say, from European banks and if you can address prime brokerage, too?Well, at least, I guess, the flipside is the market share gains.

James, having too much capital definitely in this environment is a good spot to be when you look at the global firms. But on the other hand, it does weigh on the ROE and on the multiple. So when you look at what you guys are doing strategically in terms of focusing on Wealth Management, taking down some of the risk on the balance sheet, is that starting to resonate with the regulators?

And I was just wondering how you tied that up with the make-up of your business. Why would that be the case? And especially given that you’re relatively light on FICC vs. some other peers. Is it the case that maybe that’s a reflection of maybe higher risk that you might be having in FICC and the way you run that?Right.

1358,"So, I know you're not going to answer this, but I'm going to ask it anyway. If it was up to you, what would be the appropriate level of liquidity that you would…","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}"
1359,Do you think the Volcker Rule has materially impacted market liquidity from your perspective?,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}"
1360,"Okay. So a restrictive trade policy between the U.S. and Mexico would also impact, I guess, Citigroup more than many other banks just didn't give the operations you own in that country. I think we've calculated that about 25% of your Mexican corporate loan book is to border states with the U.S. If there was a more restrictive policy, how would you think about the impact of that from a credit quality and perhaps a growth standpoint or is it again just too soon to say?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.916, 'pos': 0.084, 'compound': 0.7269}"
1361,"So, last year, you talked about Brazil and Russia as countries that you thought could pose some credit issues. The impact hasn't really been as big as I think many people thought, given some of the economic issues those countries have faced. Can you talk a little bit about why you think that was the case vis-à-vis Citigroup specifically? And secondly, as you look forward over the next couple of years, are there any countries that you would add to the list?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.964, 'pos': 0.036, 'compound': 0.4515}"
1362,"So, let's talk about Europe then in that context because, obviously, you've had Brexit, you've had the Italian referendum, you've obviously got operations across that region. How has the risks or the opportunities in the eurozone changed including the UK?","{'neg': 0.049, 'neu': 0.89, 'pos': 0.061, 'compound': 0.128}"
1363,"But how much of an opportunity is that for Citigroup? Because you're clearly seeing this retrenching in Europe, the European banking systems. You didn't mention balance sheet lending. Is that an opportunity in Europe?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.733, 'pos': 0.267, 'compound': 0.9064}"
1364,"Okay. So, let's switch gears a bit and talk about your strategic objectives. So, last year, you talked about consistent execution, you talked about investments in the card business and wealth management and increased capital returns. It feels like you've made a lot of progress on all of those areas over the last 12 months. If you were to give yourself a scorecard, what would it look like? And are those still your objectives as you think about the next two or three years?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.83, 'pos': 0.17, 'compound': 0.924}"
1365,"Okay. So, let's talk about the financial targets, the 90- to 110-basis-point ROA, let's start with that. It looks as if you'll come in below that range. But part of that is obviously the liquidity that you're carrying?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.962, 'pos': 0.038, 'compound': 0.1154}"
1366,"And the mid-50s efficiency target for Citicorp, what sort of environment do you think you need to see either economically or from a revenue standpoint to get to that number?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.877, 'pos': 0.123, 'compound': 0.4215}"
1367,"So the DTA is one of the single biggest issues in terms of driving this wedge between the ROA and the ROE. There's obviously a lot of talk around corporate tax reform and new tax regime, a lot of moving parts here. Do you think that could potentially give you more strategies to help accelerate the utilization of the DTA such as repatriation?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.953, 'pos': 0.047, 'compound': 0.4522}"
1368,"Okay. So, let's talk a little bit about Costco because that's obviously been a huge success, as you said a million sign ups. Some of the offsets to that success just from a near-term profitability standpoint of being the impact on having to build the reserve and having to obviously build rewards. We heard exactly the same thing from JPMorgan yesterday. How long do you think it will take for profitability in that book to normalize it? And what do you now think is a realistic range given the fact that it has been more successful than I think you thought at the time of launch?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.798, 'pos': 0.202, 'compound': 0.9696}"

1370,"Okay. So, let's talk about capital returns. It's obviously a critical component of the investment thesis in Citigroup. Obviously, your numbers have been moving in the right direction. I think faster than many people had anticipated. But you're still a long way off where you would ideally get to, which is I think a $15 billion to $18 billion level of capital returns. I mean, Governor Tarullo gave a speech recently that did seem to imply that payout ratios were no longer going to be something that he'd focus on as much. Obviously, it would have a very significant impact on you. What was the interpretation of that speech and how are you thinking about the path to higher capital returns from here?","{'neg': 0.036, 'neu': 0.9, 'pos': 0.064, 'compound': 0.517}"
1371,"So, how are you thinking about mix shift? So, at the moment, 85%'s buybacks, 15% is dividend. In an ideal world, is that where you would like it to be or would you like to see a more even shift?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.804, 'pos': 0.196, 'compound': 0.8299}"
1372,"When you're talking about individual emerging markets that you have big exposures to, the outlook actually sounds very benign. In broader terms for EMs, how do you assess the risks in terms of whether it's strong dollar or higher bond yields or more protectionism?","{'neg': 0.043, 'neu': 0.837, 'pos': 0.12, 'compound': 0.5849}"
1373,"You mentioned how burdensome Volcker Rule demonstration of compliance is. Can you kind of size what the operational cost of that is? So if we broaden that question, what do you think about those 29,000 people that you have, how many of them make sense to you from a risk management perspective? And I know it's a tough one to answer","{'neg': 0.109, 'neu': 0.869, 'pos': 0.023, 'compound': -0.6553}"
1374,"So, I just want to confirm that this is the trend that we're seeing develop, but looks like the checking account openings, the decline looks like it's slowed on linked months and the customer initiated closures also declined nicely. So, is that more of a trend or is there any seasonality there that helped that?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.808, 'pos': 0.192, 'compound': 0.8919}"
1375,"Right, right. Okay, good. So, that's worth noting. And then separately if I could go off to reservation here a little bit, just want to see if you can comment on the Prudential issue and if that only involves products sold via the retail locations or are your agencies impacted at all? And what other underwriters are – do you also sell insurance for that could be involved? Thanks.Got it. And those outside underwriters, I mean it's Pru and then Assurant on the insurance side, right?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.901, 'pos': 0.099, 'compound': 0.7618}"
1376,"Okay. Got it. Got it. And then separately, you take this ongoing sales practice issue and then you've got the living will objection or failure or whatever that came out as well. Can you – I know it's difficult to but can you kind of talk about the – what your thoughts are around CCAR? We're getting a ton of questions now could this point to a qualitative failure. And I know it's, you don't have the crystal ball and it's hard for you to talk about, but can you at least talk about how you're thinking about it and what your initial take would be on how this could impact it?","{'neg': 0.091, 'neu': 0.883, 'pos': 0.026, 'compound': -0.8079}"
1377,"Good morning and thanks for having the call. Couple questions here, first regarding the NSFR, you set a long-term target for the company and also where do you think the NSFR is on a ballpark basis given that we only have an NPR at this point?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.879, 'pos': 0.121, 'compound': 0.7003}"
1378,"Thank you, Celeste, and if I may follow up with another question. With regard to the SLR, if the Fed world introduce a SLR-based requirement for next year's stress test, what levers are available to the company in order to lower your leverage exposure?","{'neg': 0.108, 'neu': 0.839, 'pos': 0.054, 'compound': -0.3612}"
1379,"Hi, good morning, just two questions. The first of all, in terms of the NSFR, could you quantify how much the senior secured debt could increase, and if so, will that largely displace repo funding?","{'neg': 0.06, 'neu': 0.749, 'pos': 0.191, 'compound': 0.6597}"
1380,"So when I look at it, I should see, if I look at the debt maturities for next year, just add something on top of that to kind of to get your overall issuing plans?","{'neg': 0.073, 'neu': 0.875, 'pos': 0.052, 'compound': -0.1779}"
1381,"And then the second, just could you comment on your need for sub debt over the next 12 months please?","{'neg': 0.11, 'neu': 0.789, 'pos': 0.101, 'compound': -0.0516}"
1382,"Hi. Thank you very much for doing the call, very helpful as usual. I have a couple questions please. First is, we've seen a significant increase in floating rate issuances in the past few weeks from you and from other banks, about $10 billion or so in our models. We asked Citi and they said they're seeing strong investor demand and not having to swap is attractive. I wanted to know what's driving this from your side and what do you expect to do in the future?","{'neg': 0.016, 'neu': 0.792, 'pos': 0.192, 'compound': 0.9402}"
1383,"Okay. Sure. Thank you. And the next is on these calls structures. The question is do you expect these issuances to be a default sort of or maybe bulk of the issuances in this structures going forward? And then I would like to know your view on fair value pricing, and if you see any possibility of liquidity issues or maybe these structures trading off in a stressed market environment?Yes, okay, great. So, the question is around callable structures that we are seeing. It's a three-part question. First is, do you expect these issuances to become more of a default going forward?","{'neg': 0.022, 'neu': 0.794, 'pos': 0.184, 'compound': 0.9436}"
1384,"Okay, great. And then the second is on fair value pricing for these structures. Where do you think it's fair and are you at all concerned about liquidity issues on these structures or maybe these trading off in a stressed market environment, considering let's say it's seven non-call six and you're four years into it and the market is not good, it's market stress. Do you expect these issues to trade off? I'm trying to figure out what it is for the investor in such an environment?","{'neg': 0.077, 'neu': 0.788, 'pos': 0.135, 'compound': 0.696}"
1385,"Okay, sure. Thank you. And the last is on TruPS just jumped out on slide 14. Is it fair to assume you don't expect TruPS to be eligible in TLAC or is that because you redeemed all the TruPS and you didn't include it in the chart there?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.792, 'pos': 0.208, 'compound': 0.8519}"
1386,Is your expectation that those will be eligible for TLAC or going forward? I know the rule's not out yet but just wanted to get your -,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}"
1387,"Hi. Good morning. Thanks for doing the call. One or two follow-up questions on callable securities and a question on operations. First on the callables, could you talk about how you approach looking at TLAC treatment in penultimate year of the security? When you get 50% TLAC treatment from your two to one, does that matter to you? You did a seven non-call six deal, why not seven non-call five for the TLAC treatment or are you NSFR constrained and that's really what you're looking for? That's the first one on that.The second one is, we saw one transaction last week with multiple calls on the end. Is that something that you would look at or would you just try and keep it simple for the foreseeable future? And I have a operations question.","{'neg': 0.01, 'neu': 0.899, 'pos': 0.09, 'compound': 0.8767}"
1388,"Okay. Thank you. And second question, talked about your FICC results, good results with 25% fewer resources. Do you see these kind of numbers as replicable going forward and how would you measure that? How would you look for that?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.828, 'pos': 0.172, 'compound': 0.7691}"
1389,"And how do you, just in a general sense, we've seen massive inflows into investment-grade and high yield over the past couple of quarters. Now we're seeing some outflows from high yield. How do you judge what percentage of that business is kind of core ongoing and how much is related to flows and other types of things that may be a little bit more beyond your control?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}"
1390,"Thank you, ma'am. And I think it's a question geared towards Celeste. Celeste, as a follow up on trying to assess the NSFR impact of redeeming a callable security one year prior to maturity. So conceptually thinking, when the company takes out a security a year prior from maturity, it reduces expected outflows by, let's say 100. And then cash goes down by also a similar amount, 100. And you see it like net-net zero, the impact on the NSFR?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.876, 'pos': 0.124, 'compound': 0.8316}"
1391,"So, before we take audience questions, I thought it'd be interesting to see how they're thinking about the stock today. There have been a few headlines surrounding the company. So, Eddie, if you could pull up our first audience response question for Wells Fargo, please?So, we have to start with this question. What do you think is the earnings impact of the retail sales practices issue? One, meaningful at over 5% of EPS, given loss revenues and higher operating costs; two, modest, between 0% to 5% of EPS; and three, while community bank earnings should be impacted, we think results from the rest of the firm will offset, resulting in no impact to EPS power. Neal will then look over to your vote.And let's see what the audience thinks.All right. 50% say modest at between 0% to 5% of EPS; the next most popular is 37% says it's meaningful over 5% of earnings; and 13% say that it would have no impact. So again, very interesting as we go through – the market goes through the discovery period.","{'neg': 0.036, 'neu': 0.882, 'pos': 0.082, 'compound': 0.8295}"
1392,"Let's move on to the second audience response question, please? And I'll send you the results. Don't worry; you don't have to take a picture. At the 2016 Investor Day, actually during your presentation, you mentioned that the two-year ROE target of 11% to 14% reflects a persistent low rate environment and modest economic growth as well as ongoing risk and compliance spend. And so, to the investors, based on your post-election outlook for 2017, how do you think Wells will perform against this two-year target? And keep in mind that Neal just showed us that they posted 11.6% in the third quarter.One, outperform the range given likely higher interest rates than expected and less headwind from regulation; two, perform within the range as lower contribution from the community bank will mitigate a stronger macro backdrop; and three, underperform the range as consensus is underestimating the earnings impact from the retail sales practices issues.Got five seconds on the shot clock.Survey says 60% – 61%......agree with you that they're performing within the range; and actually, 39% of you, which is interesting given that a few of you thought that there was going to be meaningful EPS impact, thought that Wells Fargo will outperform the range and none of you thought that they would underperform.","{'neg': 0.028, 'neu': 0.864, 'pos': 0.108, 'compound': 0.9429}"
1393,"So, deregulation came up, actually, at our first three presentations – two presentations, rather. So, I thought we would pull up the third audience response question directly related to your tasks. Eddie, if you could pull up number three, please?The GOP sweep has led the market to believe that industry deregulation is in the cards. As a result, as a shareholder, what do you think Wells' long-term dividend payout will be long-term? One, nearer the current level of 37%; two, 40% to 45%; three, 45% to 50%; or four, over 50%?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.957, 'pos': 0.043, 'compound': 0.4291}"
1394,"And then, our last audience response question, just to wrap this all up before I turn it over to any questions specifically for Neal, is the catalysts for the stock. What do you think is the biggest catalyst for Wells Fargo's shares over the next 12 months to 24 months? One, better clarity around the full impact of the sales practices issues; two, delivering clean and consistent earnings results close to or better than current consensus; three, achieving solid revenue growth, regardless of the rate environment; four, renewed focus on expense management to drive the efficiency ratio lower; five, accelerating capital return with focus on the dividend.And, let's see what the shareholders think. Interesting – So 35% of you say the long-term will be between 40% to 45%; another 35% of you say will be between 45% to 50%, and 14% of you say above 50%; 16% say nearer the current level.And survey says, so 31%, interestingly, say accelerating capital return with focus on the dividend; second most popular answer is at 24%, delivering clean and consistent earnings results; 21% say better clarity around the full impact of the sales practice issues.Interestingly, that this is in line with how this question was answered at BoFA and the Goldman presentation, only 10% of you, the least popular answer, said renewed focus on expense management to drive the efficiency ratio lower.And with that, I'm happy to open the floor for questions for Neal.","{'neg': 0.008, 'neu': 0.813, 'pos': 0.179, 'compound': 0.9914}"
1395,"So, maybe, one of the – you put up a tremendous slide that had $572 billion in liquidity and at a meeting we had last time you got a tremendous amount of questions on what rate backdrop you need to see to deploy some of that liquidity, and so maybe give us a little bit of color there?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}"
1396,"Question in the audience?Yeah. Sorry, this question got asked earlier, so I'm just going to asking it in a slightly different way. Instead of asking you what piece of regulation you'd most like to see go away, I think the question really is like of all the pieces of regulations, which one or ones do you think could go away with the least sort of political and negative impact that would also be the most constructive for Wells Fargo?","{'neg': 0.059, 'neu': 0.845, 'pos': 0.096, 'compound': 0.4956}"
1397,"So I want to focus the conversation mostly on GBAM, but first I wanted to ask you a few questions about how the company is doing overall? So, I mentioned the word transformative during my introduction of you.And I think this is definitely applicable not just to GBAM but to the entire company. Can you talk a moment about the transformation that we've made as a company since the recession and where it is now?","{'neg': 0.05, 'neu': 0.879, 'pos': 0.07, 'compound': 0.1297}"
1398,"So, you mentioned expense management. The market responded tremendously when we set intermediate-term expense targets in the second quarter. Perhaps you can give us an update on how we're doing to achieve this target, and how you are balancing efficiency improvement with investing for the future?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.889, 'pos': 0.111, 'compound': 0.6705}"
1399,"That's a good segue for my next question, every time senior management does these events, the term responsible growth keeps coming up. To someone that owns the stock or is considering owning the stock, what exactly does that mean?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.818, 'pos': 0.182, 'compound': 0.7783}"
1400,So I wrote this question before the election and it's about interest rates. So they say they're going up very slowly. Are return targets or your excitement about revenue growth still valid?,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.761, 'pos': 0.239, 'compound': 0.8316}"
1401,"So, what about regulation? Do you have a stance yet on how regulation could possibly evolve under this new administration?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}"
1402,"So, any – if we could pull up the polling questions please, the first one. So, everybody has their little voting clicks. How would you describe your portfolio positioning in financial stocks excluding insurance and REITs? One, very overweight; two, slightly overweight; three, neutral; four, slightly underweight; and five, very underweight. You have five seconds on the shot clock.","{'neg': 0.089, 'neu': 0.875, 'pos': 0.037, 'compound': -0.5083}"
1403,"If we could pull up the second question. How has your view on BAC shares evolved over the past 12 months? Number one, view stock more positively; number two, view stock less positively; and number three, no change.","{'neg': 0.047, 'neu': 0.656, 'pos': 0.297, 'compound': 0.8703}"
1404," So, now that we're level setting how our audience is thinking about our stock, let's go into little bit about GBAM,. So we've digested a quarter of 2.9% GDP growth and the Fed is sending clear signals that the economy is strong enough to warrant at least one more rate hike. Do you sense that our clients both in the corporate and institutional side are already embracing the idea of the economy strengthening? And are there activity levels starting to reflect this outlook?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.866, 'pos': 0.134, 'compound': 0.9013}"
1405,"So you touched upon the fact that industry had tons of regulation. And many of the audience members, portfolio managers still cite that very reason, post-crisis regulation, as a reason not to own big banks like ours. How far along is GBAM specifically in terms of repositioning its business mix for the new regulatory world order? And are there any major priorities that are left?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.957, 'pos': 0.043, 'compound': 0.4329}"

1407,"So this next question we've talked about a lot which is the universal bank model. Most of the feedback that I get from investors is that banks like ours are too complex, but I know that you have a very specific view on the advantages of the universal bank model, and I'm wondering if you would share that with our audience today?","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.876, 'pos': 0.124, 'compound': 0.7783}"

1409,So there is also a thesis that strong players that emerge with strong regulatory ratios or a competitive advantage like you mentioned could eventually reprice some of the products to reflect the new regulatory burden. Is that actually happening or there are too many competitors in and out of certain products for that really to transpire?,"{'neg': 0.045, 'neu': 0.725, 'pos': 0.23, 'compound': 0.875}"
1410,"So, taking a step back to look at the global market share picture, we've all seen the headlines on the European players as they continued to restructure.

1414,"If we pull up one last audience response question before we turn it over for Q&A. As a shareholder, what statement most closely aligns with your view on how traditional financial institutions should allocate investment spending on innovation. One, investment spending on innovation should be top priority for financial institutions as leading the charge in innovation will better generate long-term shareholder value than short-term expense management; two, given the revenue environment, institutions should invest in innovation projects, but be mindful of self-funding these investments with savings elsewhere in the firm; and three, given the challenging revenue environment, institutions should focus on improving the bottom-line through expense management even if this means delaying innovation projects.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.829, 'pos': 0.171, 'compound': 0.9455}"
